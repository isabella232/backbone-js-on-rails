=== The Example Application

The example application is a classic todo item manager.  While this is a
popular example, it is so for a reason: the concepts and domain are familiar,
while leaving room for exploring interesting implementations like deferred
loading and file attachment.

The application uses Rails 3.1.0 and Ruby 1.9.3.  We provide an .rvmrc.

Backbone.js and Underscore.js are the non-minified versions. This is for
informational purposes, but also because the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline will
compress and minify them.

While Rails 3.1 defaults to CoffeeScript, we have decided to make all of the
example code normal Javascript as we believe that will be the most
understandable to the current readers.

The example application comes with a full test suite.  The README in the
`example_app` root directory has instructions for bootstrapping the app and
running all the tests.
