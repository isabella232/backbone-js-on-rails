The user experience can be quite a pleasure, but deeply nesting callbacks and relying the on DOM for app state aren’t.  There is a host of new JavaScript client-side frameworks blossoming, and you have no shortage of choice.</p><p>From "least similar to Backbone" to "most similar to Backbone", here are a few of the options:</p><p>Are you building a desktop-like application?  Would you benefit from a rich library of existing UI controls?  Check out Cappuccino or SproutCore.</p><p>Are you very comfortable with the model-view-view model (MVVM) pattern, perhaps from Microsoft WCF or Silverlight?  Take a look at Knockout.js, which has very robust object graph dependency tracking and declarative bindings between markup and view models.</p><p>Do you want a soup-to-nuts client-side framework, with a jQuery feel (and dependency), with generators, dependency management, builds, testing, and more?  JavaScriptMVC provides all of this, with an MVC core that supports observables and data transports like JSON over REST.  You can pick and choose a subset of functionality.</p><p>Server synchronization and data validation play a central role in structuring your application, and an opinion on it is one of the central design choices of Spine.js. Does the client generally take precedence, handling all its own validations, immediately returning to the user, and updating the server asynchronously?  Or do you have significant server-side processing and validation?  Spine.js strongly favors a client-centric approach, with a decoupled server.  There are a few other API differences, but in other respoects Spine is very similar to Backbone.</p><p>Backbone favors a pared-down and flexible approach.  There is very little in the way of inheritance or class library, and the code you write ends up feels very much like just JavaScript.  It does not prescribe much in the way of favoring a client over server, or a particular server syncronization approach.  Although this means that you may need to write some of your own conventions, Backbone is built with that in mind: the source is small, very well annotated, and modularly designed so that it is easy to change.  It is small and flexible enough to make it pleasant to introduce into an existing application, but provides enough convention and structure to help you organize your JavaScript.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_the_example_application"/>The Example Application</h3></div></div></div><p>Rails 3.1.0.rc5</p><p>Ruby 1.9.2</p><p>Backbone.js and Underscore.js are the non-minified versions. This is for
informational purposes, but also because the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline will
compress and minify them.</p><p>While Rails 3.1 defaults to CoffeeScript, we have decided to make all of the
example code normal Javascript as we believe that will be the most understandable to
the current readers.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Getting up to speed </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Organization</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
