<p>When using Backbone.js in a Rails app, you’ll have two kinds of
Backbone.js-related assets: classes, and templates.</p>

<a id="_rails_3_0_and_prior"></a>Rails 3.0 and prior</h3></div></div></div>
<p>With Rails 3.0 and prior, store your Backbone.js classes in
<code class="literal">public/javascripts</code>:</p>
<pre class="screen">public/
  javascripts/
    jquery.js
    jquery-ui.js
    collections/
      users.js
      todos.js
    models/
      user.js
      todo.js
    routers/
      users_router.js
      todos_router.js
    views/
      users/
        users_index.js
        users_new.js
        users_edit.js
      todos/
        todos_index.js</pre>
<p>If you are using templates, we prefer storing them in <code class="literal">app/templates</code> to keep
them separated from the server views:</p>
<pre class="screen">app/
  views/
    pages/
      home.html.erb
      terms.html.erb
      privacy.html.erb
      about.html.erb
  templates/
    users/
      index.jst
      new.jst
      edit.jst
    todos/
      index.jst
      show.jst</pre>
<p>On Rails 3.0 and prior apps, we use Jammit for packaging assets and
precompiling templates:</p>
<p><a class="ulink" href="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/" target="_top">http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/</a>
<a class="ulink" href="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/#jst" target="_top">http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/#jst</a></p>
<p>Jammit will make your templates available in a top-level JST object. For
example, to access the above todos/index.jst template, you would refer to it
as:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">JST['todos/index']</pre>
<p>Variables can be passed to the templates by passing a Hash to the template, as
shown below.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">JST['todos/index']({ model: this.model })</pre>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_a_note_on_jammit_and_a_jst_naming_gotcha"></a>A note on Jammit and a JST naming gotcha</h4></div></div></div>
<p>One issue with Jammit that we’ve encountered and worked around is that the JST
template path can change when adding new templates.</p>
<p>When using Jammit, there is a slightly sticky issue as an app grows from one
template subdirectory to multiple template subdirectories.</p>
<p>Let’s say you place templates in app/templates. You work for a while on the
"Tasks" feature, placing templates under app/templates/tasks. So, window.JST
looks something like:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">JST['form']
JST['show']
JST['index']</pre>
<p>Now, you add another directory under app/templates, say app/templates/user.
Now, all JST references are prefixed with their parent directory name so they
are unambiguous:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">JST['tasks/form']
JST['tasks/show']
JST['tasks/index']
JST['users/new']
JST['users/show']
JST['users/index']</pre>
<p>This breaks existing JST references. You can work around this issue by applying
the following monkeypatch to Jammit, in config/initializers/jammit.rb</p>
<pre class="programlisting">Jammit::Compressor.class_eval do
  private
  def find_base_path(path)
    File.expand_path(Rails.root.join('app','templates'))
  end
end</pre>
<p>As applications are moving to Rails 3.1, they’re also moving to Sprockets for
the asset packager.  Until then, many apps are using Jammit for asset
packaging.  One issue with Jammit we’ve encountered and worked around is that
the JST template path can change when adding new templates.  We have an open
issue and workaround:</p>

<p>Rails 3.1 introduces the asset pipeline:</p>
<p><a class="ulink" href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html" target="_top">http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html</a></p>
<p>which uses the Sprockets library for preprocessing and packaging assets:</p>
<p><a class="ulink" href="http://getsprockets.org/" target="_top">http://getsprockets.org/</a></p>
<p>To take advantage of the built-in asset pipeline, organize your Backbone.js
templates and classes in paths available to the asset pipeline.  Classes go in
<code class="literal">app/assets/javascripts/</code>, and templates go alongside, in
<code class="literal">app/assets/templates/</code>:</p>
<pre class="screen">app/
  assets/
    javascripts/
      collections/
        todos.js
      models/
        todo.js

          todos_index.js
    templates/
      todos/
        index.jst.ejs
        show.jst.ejs</pre>
<p>In Rails 3.1, jQuery is provided by the jquery-rails gem, and no longer
needs to be included in your directory structure.</p>
<p>Using Sprockets' preprocessors, we can use templates as before.  Here, we’re
using the EJS template preprocessor to provide the same functionality as
Underscore.js' templates.  It compiles the <code class="literal">*.jst</code> files and makes them
available on the client side via the <code class="literal">window.JST</code> object. Identifying the
<code class="literal">.ejs</code> extension and invoking EJS to compile the templates is managed by
Sprockets, and requires the <code class="literal">ejs</code> gem to be included in the application
Gemfile.</p>

<p>To make the <code class="literal">*.jst</code> files available and create the <code class="literal">window.JST</code> object, require
them in your application.js Sprockets manifest:</p>
<pre class="screen">//  other application requires
//= require_tree ../templates
//= require_tree .</pre>
<p>Additionally, load order for Backbone.js and your Backbone.js app is very
important. jQuery and Underscore.js must be loaded before Backbone.js, then
the Rails authenticity token patch must be applied. Then your models must be
loaded before your collections (because your collections will reference your
models) and then your routers and views must be loaded.</p>
<p>Fortunately, sprockets can handle this load order for us. When all is said and
done your application.js Sprockets manifest will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs

//= require underscore

<p>By default Backbone.js communicates with your Rails application via JSON gets
and posts. If you’ve ever made a JSON api for your Rails app, then for the most
part this will be very similar.</p>
<p>If you haven’t ever made a JSON api for your Rails application before, lucky
you, it’s pretty straightforward.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_setting_up_models"></a>Setting Up Models</h4></div></div></div>
<p>One important aspect to keep in mind as you plan out how your Backbone.js
interface will behave, and how it will use your Rails back-end is that there is
no need to have a one-to-one mapping between your Rails models and your
Backbone.js models.</p>
<p>The smaller an application is, the more likely that there will be a one-to-one
mapping between both Backbone.js and Rails models and controllers.</p>
<p>However, if you have a sufficiently complex application, its more likely that
you <span class="emphasis"><em>won’t</em></span> have a one-to-one mapping due to the differences in the tools
Backbone.js gives you and the fact that you’re building a user-interface, not a
back-end. Some of the reasons why you won’t have a one to one mapping include:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
Because you’re building a user interface, not a back-end, it’s likely that
some of your backbone models will aggregate information from multiple Rails
models into one Backbone.js model.
</li>
<li>
This Backbone.js model may or may not be named the same as one of your Rails
models.
</li>
<li>
Backbone.js gives you a new type of object not present in Rails:
Collections.
</li>
<li>
Backbone.js doesn’t have the concept of relationships out of the box.
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>With that said, lets take the simple case first and look at how you might make a
Backbone.js version of a Rails model.</p>
<p>In our example application, we have a Task model. The simplest Backbone.js
representation of this model would be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  urlRoot: '/tasks'
});</pre>
<p>The urlRoot property above indicates to Backbone.js that the server url for
instances of this model will be found at /tasks/:id.</p>
<p>In Rails, its possible to access individual Tasks, as well as all Tasks (and
query all tasks) through the same Task model. However, in Backbone.js models
only represent the singular representation of a Task. Backbone.js splits out the
plural representation of Tasks into what it calls Collections.</p>
<p>The simplex Backbone.js collection to represent our Tasks would be the
following.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task
});</pre>
<p>If we specify the url for Tasks in our collection instead, then models within
the collection will use the collection’s url to construct their own urls, and
the urlRoot no longer needs to be specified in the model. If we make that
change, then our collection and models will be as follows.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks'
});

var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({});</pre>
<p>Notice in the above model definitions that there is no specification of the
attributes on the model. Like ActiveRecord, Backbone.js models get their
attributes from the schema and data given to them. In the case of Backbonejs,
this schema and data are the JSON from the server.</p>
<p>The default JSON representation of an ActiveRecord model is a Hash that includes
all the model’s attributes. It does not include the data for any related models
or any methods on the model, but it does include the ids of any related models
as those are stories in a relation name _id attribute on the model.</p>
<p>The JSON representation of your ActiveRecord models will be retrieved by calling
to_json on them. You customize the output of to_json by overriding the as_json
method in your model.</p>
<p>The most common things you’ll do in your Rails app when working with Backbone.js
are the following.</p>
<p>Its likely that you’ll wan to switch from including all attributes by default to
excluding some attributes. This can be done by specifying explicitly only the
attributes that are to be included, or specifying the attributes that should be
included. Which one you choose will depend on how many attributes your model has
and how paranoid you are about something important appearing in the JSON when it
shouldn’t be there. If your concerned about sensitive data unintentionally being
included in the json when it shouldn’t be then you’ll want to switch to
everything being explicitly included in the json. Otherwise, its a matter of
preference and you can do what feels best for you an your app.</p>
<p>To explicitly specify the attributes to be included in the json, use the :only
option, as shown in the following as_json implementation.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:only =&gt; [ :id, :title ]))
end</pre>
<p>The above as_json override will make it so that the json will <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> include the
id and title attributes, even if there are many other attributes on the model.</p>
<p>If instead you want to include all attributes by default and just exclude a few,
you accomplish this with the :except option, as shown below.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:except =&gt; [ :encrypted_password ]))
end</pre>
<p>Another common customization you will want to do in the json is include the
output of methods on your model. This is accomplished with the :methods option,
as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:methods =&gt; [ :calculated_value ]))
end</pre>
<p>The final thing you’ll most commonly do with your JSON is include related
objects. If our Tasks have_many Comments, to include all of the JSON for
comments on a Task in the JSON for a Task. You do this with the :include option,
as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:include =&gt; [ :comments ]))
end</pre>
<p>As you probably suspect, you can then customize the JSON for the comments by
overriding the as_json method on the Comment model.</p>
<p>In Rails 3.1 ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json is set to false. This is
in contrast to Rails 3.0 which had it set to true. This reversal was made to
simplify the JSON returned by default in Rails application, but it is fairly big
change from the default behavior of Rails 3.0.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, this change is a good one, but if you’re upgrading an
existing Rails 3.0 application to Rails 3.1 and you already have a published
api or Backbone.js code, you probably want to set it back to true, as it will
cause your public api to change, breaking a lot of code, including your
Backbone.js application.</p>
<p>While these are the most common as_json options you’ll use when working with
Backbone.js, it certainly isn’t all of them. The official, complete,
documentation for the as_json method can be found here:
<a class="ulink" href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON/as_json" target="_top">http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON/as_json</a></p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_setting_up_controllers"></a>Setting Up Controllers</h4></div></div></div>
<p>The Backbone models and collections will talk to your Rails controllers. While
your models may not have a one-to-one mapping with their Rails counterparts, it
is likely that you’ll have at least one controller corresponding to every
Backbone.js model.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, Backbone.js models will communicate in the normal RESTful
way that Rails controllers understand, using the proper verbs to support the
standard RESTful Rails controller actions: index, show, create, update, and
destroy. Backbone.js does not make any use the new action.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s just up to us to write a <span class="emphasis"><em>normal</em></span> restful controller.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways you can write your controllers for interacting
with you Backbone.js models and collections. However, the newest and cleanest
way is to use the respond_with method introduced in Rails 3.0.</p>
<p>When using respond_with, in your controller you specify what formats are
supported with the method respond_to. In your individual actions, you then
specify the resource or resources to be delivered using respond_with, as shown
in the example Tasks controller and index action below.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  respond_to :html, :json

  def index
    respond_with(@tasks = Task.all)
  end
end</pre>
<p>In the above example Tasks controller, the respond_to line declares that this
controller should respond to both the HTML and JSON formats. Then, in the
index action, the respond_with call will perform the appropriate action for
the requested format.</p>
<p>The above controller is equivalent to the following one, using the older
respond_to method.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  def index
    @tasks = Task.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.json { render :json =&gt; @tasks }
    end
  end
end</pre>
<p>Using respond_with you can create succinct controllers that respond with a
normal web page, but also expose a JSON api that Backbone.js will use.</p>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title">
<a id="_validations"></a>Validations</h5></div></div></div>
<p>If a model has a validate method defined, it will be validated before it’s
attributes are set. If validation fails, no changes to the model will occur,
and the "error" event will be fired. Your validate method will be passed the
attributes that are about to be updated. You can signal that validation passed
by returning nothing from your validate method. You can signify that
validation has failed by returning something from the method. What you return
can be as simple as a string, or a more complex object that describes the
error in all its gory detail.</p>
<p>In practice, much of the validation logic for your models will continue to be
handled on the server, as fully implementing validations on the client side
would often require duplicating a lot of server-side business logic.</p>
<p>Instead, your Backbone.js applications will likely rely on server-side
validation logic. How to handle a failure scenario is passed in to Backbone.js
model save call as a callback, as shown below.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">task.save({title: "New Task title"}, {
  error: function(){
    // handle error from server
  }
});</pre>
<p>The error callback will be triggered if your server returns a non-200
response. Therefore, you’ll want your controller to return a non-200 HTTP
response code if validations fail.</p>
<p>A controller that does this would be as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  respond_to :json

  def create
    @task = Task.new(params[:task])
    if @task.save
      respond_with(@task)
    else
      respond_with(@task, :status =&gt; :unprocessable_entity)
    end
  end
end</pre>
<p>Your error callback will receive both the model as it was attempted to be
saved and the response from the server. You can take that response and handle
the errors returned by the above controller in whatever way is fit for your
application. For more information about handling and displaying errors, see
the Form helpers section of the Views and Templates chapter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a id="_setting_up_views"></a>Setting Up Views</h4></div></div></div>
<p>Most Backbone.js applications will be a "single-page app". This means that
your Rails application will render a single-page which properly sets up
Backbone.js and the data it will use. From there, ongoing interaction with
your Rails application occurs via the JSON apis.</p>
<p>The most common page for this single-page application will be the index action
of a controller, as in our example application and the tasks controller.</p>
<p>You will want to create a Hash variable in Javascript for your Backbone,js
application to reside. This variable will serve as a namespace for your
Backbone,js application. Namespacing all of the javascript is desirable to to
avoid potential collisions in naming. For example, its possible that a
Javascript library you want to use might also create a Task variable. If you
didn’t namespace your Task model then this would conflict and be unusable.</p>
<p>This variable includes a place to hold Models, Collections, Views, and Routes,
and an init method which will be called to initialize the application. Its
very common to create a new Router in the init function, and
Backbone.history.start() must be called in order to route the initial URL.
This app variable will look like the following.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">var ExampleApp = {
  Models: {},
  Collections: {},
  Views: {},
  Routers: {},
  init: function() {
    new ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks();
    Backbone.history.start();
  }
};</pre>
<p>You can find this file in the example app in
app/assets/javascripts/example_app.js.</p>
<div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Important</h3>
<p>You must instantiate a Backbone.js router before calling
Backbone.history.start() otherwise Backbone.history will be undefined.</p>
</div>
<p>Then, inside app/views/tasks/index.html.erb you will call the initialize
method. This will appear as follows.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;%= content_for :javascript do -%&gt;
  &lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
    ExampleApp.init();
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;</pre>
<p>For performance reasons, you will almost always "prime the pump" and give
Backbone.js its initial data within the HTML view for this page. In our
example, the tasks have already been provided to the view in a @tasks instance
variable, and that can be used to prime the pump, as shown below.</p>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;%= content_for :javascript do -%&gt;
  &lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
    ExampleApp.init(&lt;%= @tasks.to_json %&gt;);
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;</pre>
<p>The above example uses Erb to pass the JSON for the tasks to the init method.</p>
<p>Once you make this change, the ExampleApp.init method then becomes:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">var ExampleApp = {
  Models: {},
  Collections: {},
  Views: {},
  Routers: {},
  init: function(tasks) {
    new ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks();
    this.tasks = new ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks(tasks);
    Backbone.history.start();
  }
};</pre>
<p>Finally, you must have a Router in place which knows what to do. We’ll cover
routers in more detail in the Views and Templates chapter. For a more in-depth
presentation on writing and using routes please go there. However, routers are
an important part of the infrastructure you need to start using Backbone.js
and we can’t make our example here work without them.</p>
<p>Backbone.js routers provide methods for routing application flow based on
client-side URL fragments (#fragment).</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
<h3 class="title">Note</h3>
<p>Backbone.js now includes support for pushState, which can use real, full URLs
instead of url fragments for routing.</p>
<p>However, pushState support in Backbone.js is fully opt-in due to lack of
browser support and that additional server-side work is required to support it.</p>
<p>pustState support is current limited to the latest versions of Firefox,
Chrome, and Safari and Mobile Safari. For a full listing of support and more
information about the History API, of which pushState is a part, visit
<a class="ulink" href="http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html#how" target="_top">http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html#how</a></p>
<p>Thankfully, if you opt-in to pushState in Backbone.js, browsers that don’t
support pushState will continue to use hash-based URL fragments, and if a hash
URL is visited by a pushState-capable browser, it will be transparently
upgraded to the true URL.</p>
<p>In addition to browser support, another hurdle to seamless use of pushState is
that because the URL used are real URLs, your server must now how to render
each of the urls. For example, if your Backbone.js application as a route of
/tasks/1, your server-side application must be able to respond to that page if
the browser visits that URL directly.</p>
<p>For most applications, you can handle this by just rendering the content you
would have for the root URL and letting backbone handle the rest of the
routing to the proper location. But for full search-engine crawlability, your
server-side application will need to render the entire HTML of the requested page.</p>
</div>
<pre class="programlisting">ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {

<p>A basic router consists of a routes hash which is a mapping between url
fragments and methods on the router. If the current URL fragment, or one that
is being visited matches one of the routes in the hash, its method will be
called.</p>
<p>The example router above is all that is needed to complete our Backbone.js
infrastructure. When a user visits /tasks the index.html.erb view will be
rendered which properly initialized Backbone.js and its dependencies and the
Backbone.js models, collections, routers, and views.</p>

<p>When using Backbone.js in a Rails app, you will run into a conflict with the
Rails built in Cross Site Scripting (XSS) protection.</p>
<p>When Rails XSS is enabled, each POST or PUT request to Rails should include a
special token which is verified to ensure that the request originated from a
user which is actually using the Rails app. In recent versions of Rails,
Backbone.js Ajax requests are no exception.</p>
<p>To get around this, you have two options. Disable Rails XSS protection (not
recommended), or make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS.</p>
<p>To make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS you can monkeypatch Backbone.js
to include the Rails XSS token in any requests it makes.</p>
<p>The following is one such script.</p>

<p>The above patch depends on jQuery, and should be included in your after jQuery
and Backbone.js are loaded. Using Jammit, you’d list it below the backbone.js
file.</p>
<p>In Rails 3.1, you’ll place this file in lib/assets/javascripts. In the example
app, you can find this this in
example_app/lib/assets/javascripts/backbone.authtokenadapter.js.</p>
