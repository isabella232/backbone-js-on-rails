<title>The shift to client-side web applications</title>
<simpara>Modern web applications are increasingly rich, shifting their complexity onto
the client side.  While there are very well-understood approaches embodied in
mature frameworks to organize server-side code, frameworks for organizing your
client-side code are newer and generally still emerging.  Backbone is one such
library that provides a set of structures to help you organize your JavaScript
code.</simpara>
<simpara>Libraries like jQuery have done a great deal to help abstract inconsistencies
across browsers and provide a high-level API for making AJAX requests and
performing DOM manipulation, but larger and richer client-side applications that
lack decoupled and modular organizational structures often fall to the same few
kinds of technical debt.</simpara>
<simpara>These apps are often highly asynchronous and the path of least resistance
implementation is often to have deeply nested callbacks to describe asynchronous
behavior, with nested Ajax calls and success/failure conditional concerns
going several layers deep.</simpara>
<simpara>Rich client-side applications almost always involve a layer of state and
logic on the client side.  One way to implement this is to store domain
objects or business logic state in the DOM.  However, storing state in the DOM,
stashing your application&#8217;s data in hidden <literal>&lt;div&gt;</literal> elements
that you clone, graft, and toggle into and out of view, or reading and writing
to lengthy sets of HTML <literal>data-*</literal> attributes - can quickly get cumbersome,
repetitive, and confusing.</simpara>
<simpara>A third common feature in rich client-side apps is presenting multiple views on
a single domain object.  Consider a web conferencing application with multiple
views on the members of your contact list - each contact is rendered in brief
inside a list view, and in more specificity in a detail view.  Additionally,
your conference call history includes information about the people who
participated.  Each time an individual contact&#8217;s information changes, this
information needs to cascade to all the view representations.</simpara>
<simpara>Often this leads to a tight coupling of persistence and presentation: invoking
<literal>$.ajax</literal> to save a user&#8217;s update and then updating several specific DOM elements
upon success.</simpara>
<simpara>By separating business logic, persistence, and presentation concerns, and
providing a decoupled, event-driven way to cascade changes through a system of
observers, each module of code is more well-encapsulated and expresses a
cohesive set of responsibilities without being coupled to outside concerns.
Your application code becomes easier to test, modify, and extend, and you
can better manage its complexity while its feature set grows.</simpara>
<simpara>Granted, you can thoughtfully organize your code in a clean, coherent manner
without using an external library.  Using a library like Backbone helps you
get started more quickly, reduces the number of decisions to make, and provides
a common vocabulary for your team members or open source contributors.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re coming from a Rails background, you understand that a large part of Rails'
value is expressing and implementing highly-opinionated conventions that guide
development decisions.  Backbone doesn&#8217;t do this.  Instead of trying to serve
as "the one way" or an opinionated framework like Rails, Backbone provides a
set of structures that help you organize your application by building your own
framework with its own set of conventions.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_goals_for_this_book">
<title>Goals for this book</title>
<simpara>This book aims to cover topics that are of interest when integrating
Backbone into a Rails application.  The primary Backbone documentation is
quite good, and readible in its brevity.  While we&#8217;ll touch on introductory
topics when they are critical to understand the points at hand, this book does
not aim to provide an introduction to Backbone, and generally assumes you can
lean on the Backbone documentation to explain the details of some concepts.</simpara>
<simpara>This book also does not aim to provide a comprehensive mapping of all possible
solutions to problem domains, but rather to describe the best approaches we
have found for solving problems and organizing applications using both Rails
and Backbone.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_alternatives_to_backbone">
<title>Alternatives to Backbone</title>
<simpara>Web applications are pushing an increasing amount of behavior to the client.
The user experience can be quite a pleasure, but deeply nesting callbacks and
relying on the DOM for app state aren&#8217;t.  There is a host of new JavaScript
client-side frameworks blossoming, and you have no shortage of choice.</simpara>
<simpara>Knockout and Angular support declarative view-bindings and the model-view-view
model (MVVM) pattern.  Cappuccino and SproutCore deliver a rich library of UI
controls for building desktop-like applications.  JavaScriptMVC provides quite
a bit of structure, including dependency management and build tools.  Spine is
perhaps the most similar to Backbone, but takes an opinionated stance to
emphasize completely asynchronous client-server interactions for a faster user
experience.  Ember, originally a SproutCore rewrite, provides a host of
conventions including two-way bindings, computed properties, and auto-updating
templates.</simpara>
<simpara>Backbone favors a pared-down and flexible approach.  The code you write ends up
feeling very much like plain JavaScript.  Although you will need to write some
of your own conventions, Backbone is built to be easy to change: the source is
small, well annotated, and modularly designed.  It is small and flexible enough
to make it pleasant to introduce into an existing application, but provides
enough convention and structure to help you organize your JavaScript.  A
growing community of users brings with it a rich ecosystem of plugins, blog
articles, and support.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_the_example_application">
<title>The Example Application</title>
<simpara>The example application is a classic todo item manager.  While this is a
popular example, it is so for a reason: the concepts and domain are familiar,
while leaving room for exploring interesting implementations like deferred
loading and file attachment.</simpara>
<simpara>The application uses Rails 3.1.0 and Ruby 1.9.3.  We provide an .rvmrc.</simpara>
<simpara>The included JavaScript libraries are non-minified for readability.  This
is a general good practice, and the Rails asset pipeline will properly package
the assets for production.</simpara>
<simpara>While Rails 3.1 provides the ability to write in CoffeeScript, we have decided
to make all of the example code normal JavaScript so as to reduce the number
of new things introduced at a time.</simpara>
<simpara>The example application comes with a full test suite.  The README in the
<literal>example_app</literal> root directory has instructions for bootstrapping the app and
running all the tests.</simpara>

<title>Organization</title>
<section id="_backbone_and_mvc">
<title>Backbone and MVC</title>
<simpara>Model–View–Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern used in many
applications to isolate domain or business logic (the application logic for the user)
from the user interface (input and presentation).</simpara>
<figure><title>Model-view-controller concept</title>
<mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="image/MVCDiagram.png" width="65%" scalefit="1" align="center"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>image/MVCDiagram.png</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>In the above diagram a solid line represents a direct association and a dashed
line represents an indirect association, such as one mediated by an observer.</simpara>
<simpara>As a user of Rails, you&#8217;re likely already familiar with the concept of MVC and
the benefits that the separation of concerns can give you. However, Rails
itself is technically not traditional MVC, but a pattern called
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model2">Model2</ulink>. A traditional MVC is event-based,
and views are bound directly to models as observers, updating themselves when
the model changes.</simpara>
<simpara>Given that Javascript has events, and that much of the interactions between the
different components of Backbone in the browser are not limited to
request/response, Backbone can be structured as an actual MVC architecture.</simpara>
<simpara>That said, technically speaking, Backbone is <emphasis>not</emphasis> MVC, and Backbone
acknowledged this when it renamed Controllers to Routers in version 0.5.0.</simpara>
<simpara>What is Backbone then, if not MVC?  Classically, Views handled the presentation
of information, and Controllers would take the user input and decide what
to do with it.  In Backbone, these two concerns are merged into View classes,
which are responsible for presentation as well as both establishing and responding
to UI event bindings.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_what_goes_where">
<title>What Goes Where</title>
<simpara>Part of the initial learning curve of Backbone can be figuring out what goes
where, and mapping it to your expectations set by working with Rails.  In Rails
we have Models, Views, Controllers, and Routers.  In Backbone, we have
Models, Collections, Views, Templates, and Routers.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to note that, although Rails and Backbone share several concept
names, several of which have significant overlap, you shouldn&#8217;t try to map your
understanding of one directly onto the other.  That said, it&#8217;s valuable to draw
similarities to help ease the learning curve.</simpara>
<simpara>The models in Backbone and Rails are fairly analogous - each represents
objects in your domain, and both mix the concerns of domain logic with
persistence.  In Rails, the persistence is usually into a database, and in Backbone
it&#8217;s generally into a remote HTTP JSON API.</simpara>
<simpara>Backbone collections are just ordered sets of models.  Because it lacks
controllers, Backbone routers and views work together to pick up the
functionality provided by Rails controllers. Finally, in Rails, when we say
views, we actually mean templates, as Rails does not provide for View classes
out of th ebox.  In Backbone, however, you have a separation between the
view class and the HTML templates that they use.</simpara>
<simpara>Once you introduce Backbone into your application, you grow the layers in your
stack by four levels. This can be daunting at first, and frankly, at times it
can be difficult to keep everything going on in your application straight.
Ultimately, the additional organization and functionality of Backbone
outweighs the costs, so let&#8217;s break it down.</simpara>
<itemizedlist><title>Rails</title>

</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>

</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In a typical Rails and Backbone application, the initial interaction between
the layers will be as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A request from a user comes in the <emphasis role="strong">Rails router</emphasis> identifies what should
  handle the request based on the URL
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Rails controller action</emphasis> to handle the request is called, some initial
  processing may be performed
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Rails view template</emphasis> is rendered and returned to the user&#8217;s browser
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Rails view template</emphasis> will include <emphasis role="strong">Backbone initialization</emphasis>, usually
  this is populating some <emphasis role="strong">Backbone collections</emphasis> as sets of <emphasis role="strong">Backbone models</emphasis>
  with JSON data provided by the <emphasis role="strong">Rails view</emphasis>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Backbone router</emphasis> determines which of its methods should handle the
  display based on the URL
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Backbone router</emphasis> calls that method, some initial processing
  may be performed, and one or more <emphasis role="strong">Backbone views</emphasis> are rendered
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Backbone view</emphasis> reads <emphasis role="strong">templates</emphasis> and uses <emphasis role="strong">Backbone</emphasis> models to
  render itself onto the page
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>At this point, the user will see your application in their browser and be able to
interact with it.  The user interacting with elements on the page will trigger
actions to be taken at any level of the above sequence: <emphasis role="strong">Backbone model</emphasis>,
<emphasis role="strong">Backbone views</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">Backbone routers</emphasis>, or requests to the remote server.</simpara>
<simpara>Requests to the remote server may be any one of the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Normal requests that don&#8217;t hit Backbone and trigger a full page reload.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Normal Ajax requests, not using Backbone at all.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Ajax requests from the <emphasis role="strong">Backbone model</emphasis> or <emphasis role="strong">Backbone collection</emphasis>,
  communicating with Rails via JSON.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Generally speaking, by introducing Backbone into our application we&#8217;ll reduce
the first two types of requests, moving the bulk of client/server interaction
to requests encapsulated inside domain objects like Backbone models.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_namespacing_your_application">
<title>Namespacing your application</title>
<simpara>You will want to create an object in JavaScript for your Backbone
application to reside. This variable will serve as a namespace for your
Backbone application. Namespacing all of the JavaScript is desirable to
avoid potential collisions in naming. For example, it&#8217;s possible that a
JavaScript library you want to use might also create a Task variable. If you
didn&#8217;t namespace your Task model then this would conflict.</simpara>
<simpara>This variable includes a place to hold Models, Collections, Views, and Routes,
and an <literal>initialize</literal> function which will be called to initialize the application.</simpara>
<simpara>Typically, initializing your application will involve creating a Router and
starting Backbone history to route the initial URL fragment.  This app variable
will look like the following.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var ExampleApp = {
  Models: {},
  Collections: {},
  Views: {},
  Routers: {},
  initialize: function() {
    new ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks();
    Backbone.history.start();
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>You can find a more fully fleshed-out version of this file in the example app
in <literal>app/assets/javascripts/example_app.js</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_mixins">
<title>Mixins</title>
<simpara>Backbone provides a basic mechanism for inheritance.  Sometimes, you&#8217;ll want to
build a collection of related, reusable behavior and include that in several
classes that already inherit from a Backbone base class.  In these cases,
you&#8217;ll want to use a <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin">mixin</ulink>.</simpara>
<simpara>Backbone includes
<ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Events">Backbone.Events</ulink> as an example
of a mixin.</simpara>
<simpara>Here, we create a mixin named <literal>Observer</literal> that contains behavior for binding to
events in a fashion that can be cleaned up later:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Observer = {
  bindTo: function(source, event, callback) {
    source.on(event, callback, this);
    this.bindings = this.bindings || [];
    this.bindings.push({ source: source, event: event, callback: callback });
  },

  unbindFromAll: function() {
    _.each(this.bindings, function(binding) {
      binding.source.off(binding.event, binding.callback);
    });
    this.bindings = [];
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>We can mix <literal>Observer</literal> into a class by using Underscore&#8217;s <literal>_.extend</literal> on the
prototype of that class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">SomeCollectionView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.bindTo(this.collection, "change", this.render);
  },

  leave: function() {
    this.unbindFromAll(); // calling a method defined in the mixin
    this.remove();
  }
});

_.extend(SomeCollectionView.prototype, Observer);</programlisting>

<title>Organizing your Backbone code in a Rails app</title>
<simpara>When using Backbone in a Rails app, you&#8217;ll have two kinds of
Backbone-related assets: classes and templates.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_rails_3_0_and_prior">
<title>Rails 3.0 and prior</title>
<simpara>With Rails 3.0 and prior, store your Backbone classes in
<literal>public/javascripts</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>public/
  javascripts/
    jquery.js
    jquery-ui.js
    collections/
      users.js
      todos.js

        users_index.js
        users_new.js
        users_edit.js
      todos/
        todos_index.js</screen>
<simpara>If you are using templates, we prefer storing them in <literal>app/templates</literal> to keep
them separated from the server views:</simpara>
<screen>app/
  views/
    pages/
      home.html.erb
      terms.html.erb
      privacy.html.erb
      about.html.erb
  templates/
    users/
      index.jst
      new.jst
      edit.jst
    todos/
      index.jst
      show.jst</screen>
<simpara>On Rails 3.0 and prior apps, we use Jammit for packaging assets and
precompiling templates:</simpara>
<simpara><ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/">http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/</ulink></simpara>
<simpara><ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/#jst">http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/#jst</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>Jammit will make your templates available in a top-level JST object. For
example, to access the above todos/index.jst template, you would refer to it
as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['todos/index']</programlisting>
<simpara>Variables can be passed to the templates by passing a Hash to the template, as
shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['todos/index']({ model: this.model })</programlisting>
<note>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Jammit and a JST naming gotcha</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>One issue with Jammit that we&#8217;ve encountered and worked around is that the JST
template path can change when adding new templates.  Let&#8217;s say you place
templates in <literal>app/templates</literal>. You work for a while on the "Tasks" feature,
placing templates under <literal>app/templates/tasks</literal>. So, <literal>window.JST</literal> looks something
like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['form']
JST['show']
JST['index']</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, you add another directory under <literal>app/templates</literal>, say <literal>app/templates/user</literal>.
Now, templates with coliding names in JST references are prefixed with their
 parent directory name so they are unambiguous:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['form'] // in tasks/form.jst
JST['tasks/show']
JST['tasks/index']
JST['new']  // in users/new.jst
JST['users/show']
JST['users/index']</programlisting>
<simpara>This breaks existing JST references. You can work around this issue by applying
the following monkeypatch to Jammit, in <literal>config/initializers/jammit.rb</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">Jammit::Compressor.class_eval do
  private
  def find_base_path(path)
    File.expand_path(Rails.root.join('app','templates'))
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>As applications are moving to Rails 3.1, they&#8217;re also moving to Sprockets for
the asset packager.  Until then, many apps are using Jammit for asset
packaging.  We have an open issue and workaround:</simpara>
<simpara><ulink url="https://github.com/documentcloud/jammit/issues/192">https://github.com/documentcloud/jammit/issues/192</ulink></simpara>
</note>

<section id="_rails_3_1">
<title>Rails 3.1</title>
<simpara>Rails 3.1 introduces the
<ulink url="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">asset pipeline</ulink>, which uses
the <ulink url="http://getsprockets.org">Sprockets library</ulink> for preprocessing and packaging
assets.</simpara>
<simpara>To take advantage of the built-in asset pipeline, organize your Backbone
templates and classes in paths available to it: classes go in
<literal>app/assets/javascripts/</literal>, and templates go alongside, in
<literal>app/assets/templates/</literal>:</simpara>

    templates/
      todos/
        index.jst.ejs
        show.jst.ejs</screen>
<simpara>In Rails 3.1, jQuery is provided by the <literal>jquery-rails</literal> gem, and no longer
needs to be included in your directory structure.</simpara>
<simpara>Using Sprockets' preprocessors, we can use templates as before.  Here, we&#8217;re
using the EJS template preprocessor to provide the same functionality as
Underscore.js' templates.  It compiles the <literal>*.jst</literal> files and makes them
available on the client side via the <literal>window.JST</literal> object. Identifying the
<literal>.ejs</literal> extension and invoking EJS to compile the templates is managed by
Sprockets, and requires the <literal>ejs</literal> gem to be included in the application
Gemfile.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Underscore.js templates:

</note>
<simpara>To make the <literal>*.jst</literal> files available and create the <literal>window.JST</literal> object, require
them in your application.js Sprockets manifest:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">//  other application requires
//= require_tree ../templates
//= require_tree .</programlisting>
<simpara>Load order for Backbone and your Backbone app is very
important. jQuery and Underscore must be loaded before Backbone, then
the Rails authenticity token patch must be applied. Then your models must be
loaded before your collections (because your collections will reference your
models) and then your routers and views must be loaded.</simpara>
<simpara>Fortunately, sprockets can handle this load order for us. When all is said and
done your application.js Sprockets manifest will look as shown below.</simpara>

<title>An Overview of the Stack: Connecting Rails and Backbone</title>
<simpara>By default, Backbone communicates with your Rails application via JSON HTTP
requests. If you&#8217;ve ever made a JSON API for your Rails app, then
for the most part this will be very similar.  If you have not made a JSON API
for your Rails application before, lucky you, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward.</simpara>
<simpara>This section will briefly touch on each of the major parts of an application
using both Rails and Backbone.  We&#8217;ll go into more detail in later chapters,
but this should give you the big picture of how the pieces fit together.</simpara>
<section id="_setting_up_models">
<title>Setting Up Models</title>
<simpara>In our example application, we have a Task model, exposed via a JSON API at
<literal>/tasks</literal>. The simplest Backbone representation of this model would be as
shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  urlRoot: '/tasks'
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The urlRoot property above describes a base for the server-side JSON API that
houses this resource.  Collection-level requests will occur at that root URL,
and requests relating to instances of this model will be found at <literal>/tasks/:id</literal>.</simpara>
<note><simpara>There is no need to have a one-to-one mapping between Rails models and
Backbone models.  Backbone models instead correspond with RESTful resources.
Since your Backbone code is in the presentation tier, it&#8217;s likely that some of
your Backbone models may end up providing only a subset of the information present
in the Rails models, or they may aggregate information from multiple Rails
models into a composite resource.</simpara></note>
<simpara>In Rails, it&#8217;s possible to access individual Tasks, as well as all Tasks (and
query all tasks) through the same <literal>Task</literal> model. In Backbone, models
only represent the singular representation of a <literal>Task</literal>. Backbone splits out the
plural representation of <literal>Tasks</literal> into <literal>Collections</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The simplest Backbone collection to represent our <literal>Tasks</literal> would be the
following.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task
});</programlisting>
<simpara>If we specify the url for <literal>Tasks</literal> in our collection instead, then models within
the collection will use the collection&#8217;s url to construct their own URLs, and
the urlRoot no longer needs to be specified in the model. If we make that
change, then our collection and model will be as follows.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks'
});

var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({});</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice in the above model definitions that there is no specification of the
attributes on the model. Like ActiveRecord, Backbone models get their
attributes from the data used to populate them at runtime. In this case,
this schema and data are JSON responses from the Rails server.</simpara>
<simpara>The default JSON representation of an ActiveRecord model is an object that includes
all the model&#8217;s attributes. It does not include the data for any related models
or any methods on the model, but it does include the ids of any <literal>belongs_to</literal> relations
as those are stored in a <literal>relation_name_id</literal> attribute on the model.</simpara>
<simpara>The JSON representation of your ActiveRecord models will be retrieved by
calling <literal>to_json</literal> on them, which returns a string of JSON. Customize the output
of <literal>to_json</literal> by overriding the <literal>as_json</literal> method in your model, which returns a
Ruby data structure like a Hash or Array which will be serialized into the JSON
string.  We&#8217;ll touch on this more later in the section "Customizing your
Rails-generated JSON."</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_setting_up_rails_controllers">
<title>Setting Up Rails Controllers</title>
<simpara>The Backbone models and collections will talk to your Rails controllers. The
most basic pattern is one Rails controller providing one family of RESTful
resource to one Backbone model.</simpara>
<simpara>By default, Backbone models communicate in the normal RESTful way that Rails
controllers understand, using the proper verbs to support the standard RESTful
Rails controller actions: index, show, create, update, and destroy. Backbone
does not make any use of the new action.</simpara>
<simpara>Therefore, it&#8217;s just up to us to write a <emphasis>normal</emphasis> RESTful controller.  The
newest and most succinct way to structure these is to use the <literal>respond_with</literal>
method, introduced in Rails 3.0.</simpara>
<simpara>When using <literal>respond_with</literal>, declare supported formats with <literal>respond_to</literal>. Inside
individual actions, you then specify the resource or resources to be delivered
using <literal>respond_with</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  respond_to :html, :json

  def index
    respond_with(@tasks = Task.all)
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>In the above example Tasks controller, the <literal>respond_to</literal> line declares that this
controller should respond to requests for both the HTML and JSON formats. Then,
in the index action, the <literal>respond_with</literal> call will build a response according to
the requested content type (which may be HTML or JSON in this case) and
provided resource, <literal>@tasks</literal>.</simpara>
<section id="_validations_and_your_http_api">
<title>Validations and your HTTP API</title>
<simpara>If a Backbone model has a <literal>validate</literal> method defined, it will be validated on
the client side, before its attributes are set. If validation fails, no changes
to the model will occur, and the "error" event will be fired. Your <literal>validate</literal>
method will be passed the attributes that are about to be updated. You can
signal that validation passed by returning nothing from your <literal>validate</literal> method.
You signify that validation has failed by returning something from the method.
What you return can be as simple as a string, or a more complex object that
describes the error in all its gory detail.</simpara>
<simpara>The amount of validation you include on the client side is essentially a
tradeoff between interface performance and code duplication.  It&#8217;s important
for the server to make the last call on validation.</simpara>
<simpara>So, your Backbone applications will likely rely on at least some server-side
validation logic.  Invalid requests return non-2xx HTTP responses, which
are handled by error callbacks in Backbone:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">task.save({ title: "New Task title" }, {
  error: function() {
    // handle error from server
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The error callback will be triggered if your server returns a non-2xx
response. Therefore, you&#8217;ll want your controller to return a non-2xx HTTP
response code if validations fail.</simpara>
<simpara>A controller that does this would be as shown in the following example.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  respond_to :json

  def create
    @task = Task.new(params[:task])
    if @task.save
      respond_with(@task)
    else
      respond_with(@task, :status =&gt; :unprocessable_entity)
    end
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>The default Rails responders will respond with an unprocessable entity (422)
status code when there are validation errors, so the action above can be
refactored:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  respond_to :json
  def create
    @task = Task.new(params[:task])
    @task.save
    respond_with @task
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Your error callback will receive both the model as it was attempted to be
saved and the response from the server. You can take that response and handle
the errors returned by the above controller in whatever way is fit for your
application.</simpara>
<simpara>A few different aspects of validations that we saw here are covered in a few
different sections of this book. For more information about validations, see
the Validation section of the Models and Collections chapter. For more
information about reducing redundancy between client and server validations,
see the "Duplicating business logic across the client and server" section of
the Models and Collections chapter. For more information about handling and
displaying errors on the client side, see the "Forms" section of the
Views and Templates chapter.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_setting_up_views">
<title>Setting Up Views</title>
<simpara>Most Backbone applications will be a single-page app, or "SPA". This means that
your Rails application handles two jobs: first, it renders a single page which
hosts your Backbone application and, optionally, an initial data set for it to
use. From there, ongoing interaction with your Rails application occurs via
HTTP JSON APIs.</simpara>
<simpara>For our example application, this host page will be located at <literal>Tasks#index</literal>,
which is also routed to the root route.</simpara>
<simpara>You will want to create an object in JavaScript for your Backbone application.
Generally, we use this object as a top-level namespace for other Backbone
classes, as well as a place to hold initialization code.  For more information
on this namespacing see the "Namespacing your application" section of the
Organization chapter.</simpara>
<simpara>This application object will look like the following.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var ExampleApp = {
  Models: {},
  Collections: {},
  Views: {},
  Routers: {},
  initialize: function(data) {
    var tasks = new ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks(data.tasks);
    new ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks({ tasks: tasks });
    Backbone.history.start();
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>You can find this file in the example app in
<literal>app/assets/javascripts/example_app.js</literal>.</simpara>
<important><simpara>You must instantiate a Backbone router before calling
<literal>Backbone.history.start()</literal> otherwise <literal>Backbone.history</literal> will be <literal>undefined</literal>.</simpara></important>
<simpara>Then, inside <literal>app/views/tasks/index.html.erb</literal> you will call the <literal>initialize</literal> method.
You will often bootstrap data into the Backbone application to provide initial
state.  In our example, the tasks have already been provided to the Rails view
in a <literal>@tasks</literal> instance variable:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;%= content_for :javascript do -%&gt;
  &lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
    ExampleApp.initialize({ tasks: &lt;%== @tasks.to_json %&gt; });
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;</programlisting>
<note><simpara>The above example uses ERb to pass the JSON for the tasks to the <literal>initialize</literal>
method, but we should be mindful of the XSS risks that dumping user-generated
content here poses.  See the "Encoding data when bootstrapping JSON data"
section in the security chapter for a more secure approach.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Finally, you must have a Router in place which knows what to do.  We&#8217;ll cover
routers in more detail in the "Routers, Views and Templates" chapter.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index"
  },

  index: function() {
    // We've reached the end of Rails integration - it's all Backbone from here!

    alert('Hello, world!  This is a Backbone router action.');

    // Normally you would continue down the stack, instantiating a
    // Backbone.View class, calling render() on it, and inserting its element
    // into the DOM.

    // We'll pick back up here in the "Converting Views" section.
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The example router above is the last piece needed to complete our
initial Backbone infrastructure. When a user visits <literal>/tasks</literal> the
<literal>index.html.erb</literal> Rails view will be rendered which properly initializes
Backbone and its dependencies and the Backbone models, collections, routers,
and views.</simpara>

<section id="_customizing_your_rails_generated_json">
<title>Customizing your Rails-generated JSON</title>
<simpara>There are a few common things you&#8217;ll do in your Rails app when working with
Backbone.</simpara>
<simpara>First, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll want to switch from including all attributes,
which is the default, to delivering some subset.</simpara>
<simpara>This can be done by specifying explicitly only the attributes that are to be
included (whitelisting), or specifying the attributes that should <emphasis>not</emphasis> be
included (blacklisting). Which one you choose will depend on how many attributes
your model has and how paranoid you are about something important appearing in
the JSON when it shouldn&#8217;t be there.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re concerned about sensitive data unintentionally being included in the
JSON when it shouldn&#8217;t be, then you&#8217;ll want to whitelist attributes into the
JSON with the <literal>:only</literal> option:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:only =&gt; [ :id, :title ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>The above <literal>as_json</literal> override will make it so that the JSON will <emphasis>only</emphasis> include the
id and title attributes, even if there are many other attributes on the model.</simpara>
<simpara>If instead you want to include all attributes by default and just exclude a few,
you accomplish this with the <literal>:except</literal> option:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:except =&gt; [ :encrypted_password ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Another common customization you will want to do in the JSON is include the
output of methods (say, calculated values) on your model. This is accomplished
with the <literal>:methods</literal> option, as shown in the following example.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:methods =&gt; [ :calculated_value ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>The final thing you&#8217;ll most commonly do with your JSON is include related
objects. If the <literal>Task</literal> model <literal>has_many :comments</literal>, include all of the JSON for
comments in the JSON for a Task with the <literal>:include</literal> option:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:include =&gt; [ :comments ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>As you probably suspect, you can then customize the JSON for the comments by
overriding the <literal>as_json</literal> method on the <literal>Comment</literal> model.</simpara>
<simpara>While these are the most common <literal>as_json</literal> options you&#8217;ll use when working with
Backbone, it certainly isn&#8217;t all of them. The official, complete,
documentation for the <literal>as_json</literal> method can be found here:
<ulink url="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON/as_json">http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON/as_json</ulink></simpara>
<section id="_activerecord_base_include_root_in_json">
<title>ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json</title>
<simpara>Depending on the versions, Backbone and Rails may have different expectations
about the format of JSON structures; specifically, whether or not a root key is
present.  When generating JSON from Rails, this is controlled by the
ActiveRecord setting <literal>ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">  &gt; ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = false
  &gt; Task.last.as_json
 =&gt; {"id"=&gt;4, "title"=&gt;"Enjoy a three mile swim"}

  &gt; ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json = true
  &gt; Task.last.as_json
 =&gt; {"task"=&gt;{"id"=&gt;4, "title"=&gt;"Enjoy a three mile swim"}}</programlisting>
<simpara>In Rails 3.0, <literal>ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json</literal> is set to true. In 3.1,
it defaults to false. This reversal was made to simplify the JSON returned by
default in Rails application, but it is fairly big change from the default
behavior of Rails 3.0.</simpara>
<simpara>Practically speaking, this change is a good one, but take particular note if
you&#8217;re upgrading an existing Rails 3.0 application to Rails 3.1 and you already
have a published API; you may need to expose a new version of your API.</simpara>
<simpara>From the Backbone side, the default behavior expects no root node.  This
behavior is defined in a few places: <literal>Backbone.Collection.prototype.parse</literal>,
<literal>Backbone.Model.prototype.parse</literal>, and <literal>Backbone.Model.prototype.toJSON</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">_.extend(Backbone.Collection.prototype, Backbone.Events, {
  // http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-parse
  parse : function(resp, xhr) {
    return resp;
  },

  // snip...
});

_.extend(Backbone.Model.prototype, Backbone.Events, {
  // http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model-toJSON
  toJSON : function() {
    return _.clone(this.attributes);
  },

  // http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model-parse
  parse : function(resp, xhr) {
    return resp;
  },

  // snip...
});</programlisting>
<simpara>If you need to accept JSON with a root node, you can override <literal>parse</literal> in each of
your models, or override the prototype&#8217;s function.  You&#8217;ll need to override it
on the appropriate collection(s), too.</simpara>
<simpara>If you need to send JSON back to the server that includes a root node, you can
override <literal>toJSON</literal>, per-model or across all models.  When you do this, you&#8217;ll
need to explicitly specify the name of the root key.  We use a convention of a
<literal>modelName</literal> function on your model to provide this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">Backbone.Model.prototype.toJSON = function() {
  var hashWithRoot = {};
  hashWithRoot[this.modelName] = this.attributes;
  return _.clone(hashWithRoot);
};

var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  modelName: "task",

  // ...
});</programlisting>

<section id="_converting_an_existing_page_view_area_to_use_backbone">
<title>Converting an existing page/view area to use Backbone</title>
<simpara>This section is meant to get you started understanding how Backbone views
work by illustrating the conversion of a Rails view to a Backbone view.</simpara>
<simpara>Its important to note that a Rails view is not directly analogous to a Backbone
view. In Rails, the term "view" usually refers to an HTML template, where
Backbone views are classes that contain event handling and presentation logic.</simpara>
<simpara>Consider the following Rails view for a tasks index.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;h1&gt;Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Completed&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;% @tasks.each do |task| %&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= task.title %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= task.completed %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>So far, we have the Backbone <literal>Task</literal> model and collection and the Rails <literal>Task</literal>
model and controller discussed above, and we&#8217;re bootstrapping the Backbone app
with all the tasks.  Next, we will create a Backbone view which will render a
corresponding Backbone template.</simpara>
<simpara>A Backbone view is a class that is responsible for rendering the display of a
logical element on the page. A view alsos bind to DOM events occurring within
its DOM scope which trigger various behaviors.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll start with a basic view that achieves the same result as the Rails template
above, rendering a collection of tasks:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function () {
    this.$el.html(JST['tasks/index']({ tasks: this.collection }));
    return this;
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>render</literal> method above renders the <emphasis>tasks/index</emphasis> JST template, passing
the collection of tasks into the template.</simpara>
<simpara>Each Backbone view has an element which it stores in <literal>this.$el</literal>.  This element
can be populated with content, although it&#8217;s a good practice for code outside
the view to actually insert the view into the DOM.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll update the Backbone route to instantiate this view, passing in the
collection for it to render. The router then renders the view, and inserts it
into the DOM:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index"
  },

  index: function() {
    var view = new ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex({ collection: ExampleApp.tasks });
    $('body').html(view.render().$el);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Now that we have the Backbone view in place that renders the template, and
it&#8217;s being called by the router, we can focus on converting the above Rails
view to a Backbone template.</simpara>
<simpara>Backbone depends on Underscore.js which, among many things, provides
templating.  The delimiter and basic concepts used for both Underscore
templates and ERb are the same.  When converting an existing Rails application
to Backbone, this similarity can help ease the transition.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>tasks/index</literal> JST template does two things:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Loops over all of the tasks
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
For each task, it outputs the task title and completed attributes
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Underscore provides many iteration functions that will be familiar to Rails
developers such as  <literal>_.each</literal>, <literal>_.map</literal>, and <literal>_.reject</literal>. Backbone also proxies to
Underscore to provide these iteration functions as methods on <literal>Backbone.Collection</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll use the <literal>each</literal> method to iterate through the <literal>Tasks</literal> collection that was
passed to the view, as shown in the converted Underscore template below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;h1&gt;Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Completed&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;% tasks.each(function(model) { %&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= model.escape('title') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= model.escape('completed') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;% }); %&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>In Rails 3.0 and above template output is HTML-escaped by default. In order to
ensure that we have the same XSS protection as we did in our Rails template, we
access and output the Backbone model attributes using the <literal>escape</literal> method
instead of the normal <literal>get</literal> method.</simpara>
<section id="_breaking_out_the_taskview">
<title>Breaking out the TaskView</title>
<simpara>In Backbone, views are often bound to an underlying model, re-rendering
themselves when the model data changes.  Consider what happens when any task
changes data with our approach above; the entire collection must be
re-rendered.  It&#8217;s useful to break up these composite views into two separate
classes, each with their own responsibility: a parent view who handles the
aggregation, and a child view responsible for rendering each node of content.</simpara>
<simpara>With each of the <literal>Task</literal> models represented by an individual <literal>TaskView</literal>,
changes to an individual model are broadcast to its corresponding <literal>TaskView</literal>,
which re-renders only the markup for one task.</simpara>
<simpara>Continuing our example from above, a <literal>TaskView</literal> will be responsible for
rendering just the individual table row for a <literal>Task</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;tr&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= model.escape('title') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= model.escape('completed') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>And the Task index template will be changed to be as shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;h1&gt;Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;Completed&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;!-- child content will be rendered here --&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>As you can see above in the index template, the individual tasks are no longer
iterated over and rendered inside the table, but instead within the
<literal>TasksIndex</literal> and <literal>TaskView</literal> views, respectively:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Views.TaskView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function () {
    this.$el.html(JST['tasks/view']({ model: this.model }));
    return this;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>TaskView</literal> view above is very similar to the one we saw previously for the
<literal>TasksIndex</literal> view.  It is only responsible for rendering the contents of its own
element, and the concern of assembling `TaskView`s into a list is left to the
parent view object:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function () {
    var self = this;

    this.$el.html(JST['tasks/index']()); // Note that no collection is needed
                                         // to build the container markup.

    this.collection.each(function(task) {
      var taskView = new ExampleApp.Views.TaskView({ model: task });
      self.$('table').append(taskView.render().el);
    });

    return this;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>In the new <literal>TasksIndex</literal> view above, the <literal>tasks</literal> collection is iterated over. For
each task, a new <literal>TaskView</literal> is instantiated, rendered, and then inserted into
the <literal>&lt;table&gt;</literal> element.</simpara>
<simpara>If you take a look at the output of the <literal>TasksIndex</literal>, it will appear as follows.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Completed&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Task 1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Task 2&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Unfortunately, we can see that there is a problem with the above rendered
view, and that is the surrounding div around each of the rendered tasks.</simpara>
<simpara>Each of the rendered tasks has a surrounding div because this is the element
that each view has that is accessed via this.el, and what the view&#8217;s content
is inserted into. By default, this element is a div and therefore every view
will be wrapped in an extra div. While sometimes this extra div doesn&#8217;t really
matter, as in the outermost div that wraps the entire index, other times this
produced invalid markup.</simpara>
<simpara>Fortunately, Backbone provides us with a clean and simple mechanism for
changing the element to something other than a div. In the case of the
TaskView, we would like this element to be a tr, then the wrapping tr can be
removed from the task view template.</simpara>
<simpara>The element to use is specified by the tagName member of the TaskView, as
shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Views.TaskView = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: "tr",

  initialize: function() {
  },

  render: function () {
    this.$el.html(JST['tasks/view']({ model: this.model }));
    return this;
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>Given the above tagName customization, the task view template will be as
follows.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;td&gt;&lt;%= model.escape('title') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;%= model.escape('completed') %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>And the resulting output of the <literal>TasksIndex</literal> will be much cleaner, as shown
below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Completed&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Task 1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Task 2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve now covered the basic building blocks of converting Rails views to
Backbone and getting a functional system. The majority of Backbone programming
you will do will likely be in the Views and templates and there is a lot more
to them: event binding, different templating strategies, helpers, event
unbinding, and more. Those topics are covered in the "Routers, Views, and
Templates" chapter.</simpara>

<title>Routers, Views, and Templates</title>
<section id="_view_explanation">
<title>View explanation</title>
<simpara>A Backbone view is a class that is responsible for rendering the display of
a logical element on the page. A view can also bind to events which may cause
it to be re-rendered.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to note that a Rails view is not directly analogous to a
Backbone view. A Rails view is more like a Backbone template, and
Backbone views are often more like Rails controllers, in that they are
responsible for deciding what should be rendered and how, and for rendering the
actual template file. This can cause confusion with developers just starting
with Backbone.</simpara>
<simpara>A basic Backbone view appears as follows.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Views.ExampleView = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: "li",
  className: "example",
  id: "example_view",

  events: {
    "click a.save": "save"
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(JST['example/view']({ model: this.model }));
    return this;
  },

  save: function() {
    // do something
  }
};</programlisting>
<section id="_initialization">
<title>Initialization</title>
<simpara>Backbone views could also include an <literal>initialize</literal> function which will
be called when the view is instantiated.</simpara>
<simpara>You only need to specify the initialize function if you wish to do something
custom. For example, some views call the <literal>render()</literal> function upon
instantiation. It&#8217;s not necessary to immediately render that way,
but it&#8217;s relatively common to do so.</simpara>
<simpara>You create a new view by instantiating it with <literal>new</literal>. For example <literal>new
ExampleView()</literal>. It is possible to pass in a hash of options with <literal>new
ExampleView(options)</literal>. Any options you pass into the constructor will be
available inside of the view in <literal>this.options</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few special options that, when passed, will be assigned as
properties of view. These are <literal>model</literal>, <literal>collection</literal>, <literal>el</literal>, <literal>id</literal>,
<literal>className</literal>, and <literal>tagName</literal>. For example, if you create a new view and give it
a model option using <literal>new ExampleView({ model: someTask })</literal>, then inside of the view
<literal>someTask</literal> will be available as <literal>this.model</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_the_view_8217_s_element">
<title>The View&#8217;s Element</title>
<simpara>Each Backbone view has an element which it stores in <literal>this.el</literal>. This element
can be populated with content, but isn&#8217;t on the page until placed there by
you. Using this strategy it is then possible to render views outside of the
current DOM at any time, and then later in your code, insert the new elements all
at once. In this way, high performance rendering of views can be achieved with as
few reflows and repaints as possible.</simpara>
<simpara>A jQuery or Zepto object of the view&#8217;s element is available in <literal>this.$el</literal>.
This is useful so you don&#8217;t need to repeatedly call <literal>$(this.el)</literal>. This jQuery
or Zepto call is also cached, so it should be a performance improvement over
repeatedly calling <literal>$(this.el)</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>It is possible to create a view that references an element already in the DOM,
instead of a new element. To do this, pass in the existing element as an
option to the view constructor with <literal>new ExampleView({ el: existingElement })</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You can also set this after the fact with the <literal>setElement()</literal> function.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var view = new ExampleView();
view.setElement(existingElement);</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_customizing_the_view_8217_s_element">
<title>Customizing the View&#8217;s Element</title>
<simpara>You can use <literal>tagName</literal>, <literal>className</literal>, and <literal>id</literal> to customize the new element
created for the view. If no customization is done, the element is an empty
<literal>div</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>tagName</literal>, <literal>className</literal>, and <literal>id</literal> can either be specified directly on the view
or passed in as options at instantiation time. Since <literal>id</literal> will usually to correspond
to the <literal>id</literal> of each model, it will likely be passed in as an option rather
than declared statically in the view.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>tagName</literal> will change the element that is created from a <literal>div</literal> to something
else that you specify. For example, setting <literal>tagName: "li"</literal> will result in the
view&#8217;s element being an <literal>li</literal> rather than a <literal>div</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>className</literal> will add an additional class to the element that is created for
the view. For example, setting <literal>className: "example"</literal> in the view will result
in that view&#8217;s element having that additional class like <literal>&lt;div class="example"&gt;</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_rendering">
<title>Rendering</title>
<simpara>The <literal>render</literal> function above renders the <literal>example/view</literal> template. Template
rendering is covered in depth in the "Templating strategy" chapter. Suffice to
say, nearly every view&#8217;s render function will render some form of template. Once
that template is rendered, other actions to modify the view may be taken.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition to rendering a template, typical responsibilities of the <literal>render</literal> function
could include adding additional classes or attributes to <literal>this.el</literal>, or firing or
binding other events.</simpara>
<simpara>Backbone, when used with jQuery (or Zepto) provides a convenience function
of <literal>this.$</literal> that can be used for selecting elements inside of the view.
<literal>this.$(selector)</literal> is equivalent to the jQuery function call <literal>$(selector,
this.el)</literal></simpara>
<simpara>A nice convention of the render function is to return <literal>this</literal> at the end of
render to enable chained calls on the view - usually fetching the element.
For example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">render: function() {
  this.$el.html(this.childView.render().el);
  return this;
}</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_events">
<title>Events</title>
<simpara>The view&#8217;s <literal>events</literal> hash specifies a mapping of the events and elements that
should have events bound, and the functions that should be bound to those
events. In the example above the <literal>click</literal> event is being bound to the
element(s) that match the selector <literal>a.save</literal> within the view&#8217;s element. When
that event fires, the <literal>save</literal> function will be called on the view.</simpara>
<simpara>When event bindings are delcared with the <literal>events</literal> hash, the DOM events are bound
with the <literal>$.delegate()</literal> function. Backbone also takes care of binding the
event handlers' <literal>this</literal> to the view instance using <literal>_.on()</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Event binding is covered in great detail in the "Event binding" chapter.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_templating_strategy">
<title>Templating strategy</title>
<simpara>There&#8217;s no shortage of templating options for JavaScript.</simpara>
<simpara>They generally fall into three categories:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
HTML with JavaScript expressions interpolated. Examples: <literal>_.template</literal>, EJS.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
HTML with other expressions interpolated, often logic-free. Examples: mustache, handlebars, <literal>jQuery.tmpl</literal>
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Selector-based content declarations. Examples: PURE, just using jQuery from view classes.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>To quickly compare the different approaches, we will work with creating a
template that renders the following HTML:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;ul class="tasks"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="title"&gt;Buy milk&lt;/span&gt; Get the good kind &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="title"&gt;Buy cheese&lt;/span&gt; Sharp cheddar &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="title"&gt;Eat cheeseburger&lt;/span&gt; Make with above cheese &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Assuming we have a TasksCollection instance containing the three elements
displayed in the above HTML snippet, let&#8217;s look at how different templating
libraries accomplish the same goal of rendering the above.</simpara>
<simpara>Since you&#8217;re already familiar with underscore templates, let&#8217;s start there.</simpara>
<simpara>An underscore template may look like so:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;ul class="tasks"&gt;
  &lt;% tasks.each(function(task) { %&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span class="title"&gt; &lt;%= task.escape("title") %&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;%= task.escape("body") %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;% }) %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Here we interpolate a bit of javascript logic in order to iterate
through the collection and render the desired markup. Also note
that we must fetch escaped values from the task objects, as underscore
templates do not perform any escaping on their own.</simpara>
<simpara>This is probably the path of least resistance on a Rails Backbone app.
Since Backbone depends on underscore.js, it is already available in
your app. As has already been shown on earlier chapters, its usage
is very similar to ERB. It has the same <literal>&lt;%=</literal> and <literal>%&gt;</literal> syntax as ERB,
and you can pass it an options object that is made available to the
template when it&#8217;s rendered.</simpara>
<simpara>While we&#8217;ve found underscore&#8217;s templating to be useful and sufficient to
build large backbone applications, there are other templating libraries
that are worth mentioning here because they either provide richer
functionality or take a different approach to templating.</simpara>
<simpara>Handlebars is one such example. One major difference with underscore is
that it allows you to define and register helpers that can be used when
rendering a template, providing a framework for writing helpers similar
to those found in ActionView::Helpers, like <literal>domID</literal> or other generic
rendering logic. It also alows you to write what are called "block helpers",
which are functions that are executed on a different, supplied context during
rendering. Handlebars itself exploits this functionality by providing
a few helpers out of the box. These helpers are <literal>with</literal>, <literal>each</literal>, <literal>if</literal>
and <literal>unless</literal>, and simply provide control structures for rendering logic.</simpara>
<simpara>The above template would look like so in Handlebars:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;ul class="title"&gt;
  {{#each tasks}}
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;span class="title"&gt; {{ this.get("title") }} &lt;/span&gt;
        {{ this.get("body") }} %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  {{/each}}
&lt;ul&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Of note:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Use of <literal>{{#each}}</literal>, which iterates over the collection
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Within the <literal>{{#each}}</literal> block, the javascript context is
  the task itself, so you access it&#8217;s properties via <literal>this</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
There&#8217;s no need to escape HTML output, as handlebars escapes
  by default.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>A similar library is Mustache.js. Mustache is a templating system
that has been ported to a number of languages including javascript. The
promise of Mustache is "logic-less templates". Instead of requiring you to write
logic in pure javascript, using <literal>if</literal> for example, Mustache provides a set of tags
that take on different meanings. They can render values or not render anything at
all.</simpara>
<simpara>Both Handlebars and Mustache HTML escape rendered values by default.</simpara>
<simpara>You can learn more about handlebars at the
<ulink url="http://www.handlebarsjs.com/">project&#8217;s home on the web</ulink>,
and mustache at

<section id="_choosing_a_strategy">
<title>Choosing a strategy</title>
<simpara>Like any technology choice, there are trade-offs to evaluate and external forces
to consider when choosing a templating approach.</simpara>
<simpara>One of the common questions we&#8217;ve found ourselves asking is: Do I
already have server-side templates written that I&#8217;d like to "Backbone-ify," or
am I writing new Backbone functionality from scratch? Each of these scenarios
is described in more detail in the following sections.</simpara>
<section id="_when_you_are_adding_backbone_to_existing_rails_views">
<title>When you are adding Backbone to existing Rails views</title>
<simpara>If you are replacing existing Rails app pages with Backbone, you are already
using a templating engine, and it&#8217;s likely ERb. When making the switch to
Backbone, change as few things as possible at a time, and stick with your
existing templating approach.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re using ERb, give <literal>_.template</literal> a shot. It defaults to the same
delimiters as ERb for interpolation and evaluation, <literal>&lt;%= %&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;% %&gt;</literal>,
which can be a boon or can be confusing. If you&#8217;d like to change them,
you can update <literal>.templateSettings</literal> - check the Underscore.js docs.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re using Haml, check out the <literal>jquery-haml</literal> and <literal>haml-js</literal> projects.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re using Mustache.rb or Handlebars.rb, you&#8217;re likely aware that
Javascript implementations of these both exist, and that your existing
templates can be moved over much like the ERb case.</simpara>
<simpara>Ultimately you should choose a templating strategy that your entire team is
comfortable with, while minimizing the cost of rewriting templates.  Make sure
that designers' considerations are taken into account because it will affect how
they work with that area of the app as well.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_when_you_are_writing_new_backbone_functionality_from_scratch">
<title>When you are writing new Backbone functionality from scratch</title>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re not migrating from existing server-side view templates,
you have more freedom of choice. Strongly consider the option of no templating
at all, but rather using plain HTML templates, and then decorating the DOM from
your view class.</simpara>
<simpara>You can build static HTML mockups of the application first, and pull these
mockups directly in as templates, without modifying them.</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- snip --&gt;
&lt;div id="song-player"&gt;
  &lt;nav&gt;
    &lt;a class="home"    href="#/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a class="profile" href="/profile.html"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Song title&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;audio controls="controls"&gt;
    &lt;source src="/test.ogg" type="audio/ogg" /&gt;
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  &lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- snip --&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {
    this.renderTemplate();
    this.fillTemplate();
  },

  renderTemplate: function() {
    this.$el.html(JST['songs/index']();
  },

  fillTemplate: function() {
    this.$('nav a.profile').text(App.currentUser().fullName());
    this.$('h2').html(this.model.escape('title'));

    var audio = this.$('audio');
    audio.empty();
    this.model.formats.each(function(format) {
      $("&lt;source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;")
        .attr("src",  format.get('src'))
        .attr("type", format.get('type'))
        .appendTo(audio);
    });
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>You can see an example of this in the example application&#8217;s <literal>TaskItem</literal> view
class, at <literal>app/assets/javascripts/views/task_item.js</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The only disadvantage of this is that your view&#8217;s <literal>render()</literal> functions become
more coupled to the structure of the HTML. This means that a major change in the
markup may break the rendering because the selectors used to replace parts
of the DOM may no longer find the same elements, or may not find any elements
at all.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_routers">
<title>Routers</title>
<simpara>Routers are an important part of the Backbone infrastructure. Backbone
routers provide methods for routing application flow based on client-side URL
fragments (<literal>yourapp.com/tasks#fragment</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>Routes are meant to represent serializable, bookmarkable entry points into your
Backbone application.  This means that the pertinent application state is
serialized into the route fragment and that, given a route, you can completely
restore that application state.  They serve as navigational checkpoints, and
determine the granularity at which users nagivate "Back" in your application.</simpara>
<simpara>As an aside, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that, quite likely, there will be many
states in your application that you don&#8217;t want represented by a route - modes
in your application that users don&#8217;t really care about returning exactly to, or
where the cost of building the code that reconstructs the state is too
expensive to justify it.  For example, you may have a tabbed navigation,
expandable information panes, modal dialog boxes, or resizable display ports
that all go untracked by routes.</simpara>
<simpara>Anecdotally, one recent client application we developed has around 100 Backbone
view classes, but fewer than twenty routes.  Additionally, many of the view
classes are displayed in parallel and have multiple internal states of their own,
providing for far more than 100 different interfaces states.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Backbone now includes support for pushState, which can use real, full URLs
instead of url fragments for routing.</simpara>
<simpara>However, pushState support in Backbone is fully opt-in due to lack of
browser support and that additional server-side work is required to support it.</simpara>
<simpara>pushState support is current limited to the latest versions of Firefox,
Chrome, and Safari and Mobile Safari. For a full listing of support and more
information about the History API, of which pushState is a part, visit
<ulink url="http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html#how">http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html#how</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>Thankfully, if you opt-in to pushState in Backbone, browsers that don&#8217;t
support pushState will continue to use hash-based URL fragments, and if a hash
URL is visited by a pushState-capable browser, it will be transparently
upgraded to the true URL.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition to browser support, another hurdle to seamless use of pushState is
that because the URL used are real URLs, your server must know how to render
each of the URLs. For example, if your Backbone application has a route of
<literal>/tasks/1</literal>, your server-side application must be able to respond to that page if
the browser visits that URL directly.</simpara>
<simpara>For most applications, you can handle this by just rendering the content you
would have for the root URL and letting Backbone handle the rest of the
routing to the proper location. But for full search-engine crawlability, your
server-side application will need to render the entire HTML of the requested page.</simpara>
<simpara>For all the reasons and complications above, the examples in this book all
currently use URL fragments and not pushState.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>A typical Backbone router will appear as shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Routers.ExampleRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    ""         : "index"
    "show/:id" : "show"
  },

  index: function() {
    // Instantiate and render the index view
  }

  show: function(id) {
    // Instantiate and render the show view
  }
});</programlisting>
<section id="_the_routes_hash">
<title>The Routes Hash</title>
<simpara>The basic router consists of a routes hash which is a mapping between URL
fragments and methods on the router. If the current URL fragment, or one that
is being visited matches one of the routes in the hash, its method will be
called.</simpara>
<simpara>Like Rails routes, Backbone routes can contain parameter parts, as seen in
the <literal>show</literal> route in the example above. In this route, the part of the fragment
after <literal>show/</literal> will then be based as an argument to the <literal>show</literal> method.</simpara>
<simpara>Multiple parameters are possible, as well. For example, a route of
<literal>search/:query/p:page</literal> will match a fragment of <literal>search/completed/p2</literal> passing
<literal>completed</literal> and <literal>2</literal> to the action.</simpara>
<simpara>In the routes, <literal>/</literal> is the natural separator. For example, a route of
<literal>show/:id</literal> will not match a fragment of <literal>show/1/2</literal>. To allow you to match
fragments like this, Backbone provides the concept of splat parts,
identified by <literal>*</literal> instead of <literal>:</literal>. For example, a route of <literal>show/*id</literal> would
match the previous fragment, and <literal>1/2</literal> would be passed to the action as the
<literal>id</literal> variable.</simpara>
<simpara>Routing occurs when the browser&#8217;s URL changes. This can occur when a link is clicked,
when a URL is entered into the browser&#8217;s URL bar, or when the back button is clicked.
In all of those cases, Backbone will look to see if the new URL fragment
matches an existing route. If it does, the specified function will be called
with any parameters extracted from the URL fragment.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition, an event with the name of "route" and the function will be
triggered. For example, when the router&#8217;s <literal>show</literal> function above is triggered, an event of
<literal>route:show</literal> will be fired. This is so that other objects can listen to the
router, and be notified when the router responds to certain routes.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_initializing_a_router">
<title>Initializing a Router</title>
<simpara>It is possible to specify an <literal>initialize</literal> function in a Router which will be
called when the Router is instantiated. Any arguments passed to the router&#8217;s
constructor will be passed to this <literal>initialize</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, it is possible to pass the routes for a router via the
constructor like <literal>new ExampleRouter({ routes: { "" : "index" }}</literal>. But note
that this will override any routes defined in the routes hash on the router
itself.</simpara>

<section id="_event_binding">
<title>Event binding</title>
<simpara>A big part of writing snappy rich client applications is building models and
views that update in real-time with respect to one another. With Backbone
you accomplish this with events.</simpara>
<simpara>Client-side applications are asynchronous by nature. At the heart of a Backbone
application lie events binding and triggering. Your application is written
using event-driven programming where components emit and handle events,
achieving non-blocking UIs.</simpara>
<simpara>With Backbone, it&#8217;s very easy to write such applications. Backbone provides
the <literal>Backbone.Events</literal> mixin, which can be included in any other class.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s a quick example of a very simple game engine, where things happen in the
system and an event is triggered, which in turn invokes any event handlers that
are bound to that event.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var gameEngine = {};
_.extend(gameEngine, Backbone.Events);

gameEngine.on("user_registered", function(user) {
  user.points += 10
});

gameEngine.trigger("user_registered", User.new({ points: 0 }));</programlisting>
<simpara>In the example above, <literal>on</literal> subscribes the gameEngine to listen for the
"user_registered" event, and then <literal>trigger</literal> broadcasts that event to all
subscribed listeners, which invokes the function that adds points to the user.
Any arguments passed to <literal>trigger</literal> after the name of the event are in turn
passed to the event handler.  So in this case the output of <literal>User.new()</literal> is
received as <literal>user</literal> in the handler.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>Backbone.Views</literal>, <literal>Backbone.Model</literal> and <literal>Backbone.Collection</literal> are all extended
with <literal>Backbone.Events</literal>. There are some events that are triggered by Backbone at
particular convenient moments. These are common events that many user interface
flows need to react to.  For example, when a Backbone model&#8217;s attributes are
changed, that model will trigger the <literal>change</literal> event. It is still up to you to
bind a handler on those events.  More on that later.</simpara>
<simpara>As you can see from the example though, it is possible to bind and trigger
arbitrary events on any object that extends <literal>Backbone.Events</literal>. Additionally,
if an event handler should always trigger regardless of which event got fired,
you can bind to the special <literal>all</literal> event.</simpara>
<simpara>There are three primary kinds of events that your views will bind to:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
DOM events within the view&#8217;s <literal>this.el</literal> element
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Events triggered by closely associated objects, such as the view&#8217;s model or
collection
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Events your view itself publishes
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Event bindings declared on your view will need to be cleaned when your view is
disposed of. Events that your view publishes will need to be handled a
different way. Each of these three categories of events is discussed in more
detail below.</simpara>
<section id="_binding_to_dom_events_within_the_view_element">
<title>Binding to DOM events within the view element</title>
<simpara>The primary function of a view class is to provide behavior for its markup&#8217;s
DOM elements. You can attach event listeners by hand if you like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- templates/soundboard.jst --&gt;
&lt;a class="sound"&gt;Honk&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class="sound"&gt;Beep&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var SoundBoard = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: function() {
    $(this.el).html(JST['soundboard']());
    this.$("a.sound").bind("click", this.playSound);
  },

  playSound: function() {
    // play sound for this element
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>But Backbone provides an easier and more declarative approach with the <literal>events</literal> hash:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var SoundBoard = Backbone.View.extend({
  events: {
    "click a.sound": "playSound"
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(JST['soundboard']());
  },

  playSound: function() {
    // play sound for this element
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Backbone will bind the events with the
<ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View-delegateEvents">Backbone.View.prototype.delegateEvents()</ulink>
function.  It binds DOM events with <literal>$.delegate()</literal>, whether you&#8217;re using the
<ulink url="http://api.jquery.com/delegate/">jQuery</ulink> or
<ulink url="https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/blob/v0.7/src/event.js#L96-108">Zepto</ulink>
<literal>.delegate()</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>It also takes care of binding the event handlers' <literal>this</literal> to the view instance
using <literal>_.on()</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_events_observed_by_your_view">
<title>Events Observed by Your View</title>
<simpara>In almost every view you write, the view will be bound to a <literal>Backbone.Model</literal> or
a <literal>Backbone.Collection</literal>, most often with the convenience properties <literal>this.model</literal>
or <literal>this.collection</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Consider a view that displays a collection of <literal>Task</literal> models. It will re-render
itself when any model in the collection is changed or removed, or when a new
model is added:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TasksIndexView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: JST['tasks/tasks_index'],
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'tasks',

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "render");

    this.collection.bind("change", this.render);
    this.collection.bind("add",    this.render);
    this.collection.bind("remove", this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template({tasks: this.collection}));
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Note how we bind to the collection&#8217;s <literal>change</literal>, <literal>add</literal> and <literal>remove</literal> events.
The <literal>add</literal> and <literal>remove</literal> events are triggered when you either <literal>add()</literal> or <literal>remove()</literal>
a model from that collection as expected. The <literal>change</literal> event requires special
mention; it will trigger when any of the underlying models' <literal>change</literal> event triggers.
Backbone just bubbles up that event to the containing collection for convenience.</simpara>
<simpara>While the most common view bindings will be to events from its associated
models and collections, your view can bind to any events to which it wants to
listen.  The life-cycle for the binding and unbinding, and the handling of
these events will be the same as those for Model and Collections.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_events_your_view_publishes">
<title>Events Your View Publishes</title>
<simpara>With sufficiently complex views, you may encounter a situation where you want
one view to change in response to another.</simpara>
<simpara>This can be accomplished with events. Your view can trigger an event to which
the other view has bindings.</simpara>
<simpara>Consider a simple example with a table of users and a toggle control that
filters the users to a particular gender:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">GenderPicker = Backbone.View.extend({
  render: {
    // render template
  },
  events: {
    "click .show-male":   "showMale",
    "click .show-female": "showFemale",
    "click .show-both":   "showBoth"
  },

  showMale: function()   { this.trigger("changed", "male");   },
  showFemale: function() { this.trigger("changed", "female"); },
  showBoth: function()   { this.trigger("changed", "both");   }
});

UsersTable = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.genderPicker = new GenderPicker();
    this.genderPicker.on("changed", this.filterByGender);
    this.collectionToRender = this.collection;
    this.render();
  },

  render: {
    this.genderPicker.render();
    this.$el.html(JST['users']({ users: this.collectionToRender }));
  }

  filterByGender: function(gender) {
    this.collectionToRender = this.collection.byGender(gender);
    this.render();
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>In the above snippet, the <literal>GenderPicker</literal> is responsible for the filter
control. When a the appropriate elements are clicked, a custom <literal>changed</literal> event
is triggered on itself. Note how it is also possible to pass arbitrary
parameters to the <literal>trigger()</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>On the other hand, we have a <literal>UsersTable</literal> which is responsible for
rendering a collection of users. It also observes this event via the call to
<literal>on()</literal>, where it invokes the <literal>filterByGender</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>While your views will generally bind to events on models and collections, a
situation like the above may arise where it is handy to trigger and bind to
custom events at the view layer. However, it&#8217;s always a good idea to step
back and think through whether you should instead be binding to events on the
underlying components.</simpara>

</section>
<section id="_cleaning_up_unbinding">
<title>Cleaning Up: Unbinding</title>
<simpara>In the last section, we discussed three different kinds of event binding in
your <literal>Backbone.Views</literal> classes: DOM events, model/collection events, and custom
view events.  Next we&#8217;ll discuss unbinding these events: why it&#8217;s a good idea,
and how to do it.</simpara>
<section id="_why_unbind_events">
<title>Why unbind events?</title>
<simpara>Consider two views in a Todo app: an index view which contains all the tasks
that need to be done:</simpara>
<figure><title>Tasks index view</title>
<mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="views_and_templates/tasks-index.png" width="65%" scalefit="1" align="center"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>views_and_templates/tasks-index.png</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>and a detail view that shows detail on one task:</simpara>
<figure><title>Tasks detail view</title>
<mediaobject>
  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="views_and_templates/task-detail.png" width="65%" scalefit="1" align="center"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>views_and_templates/task-detail.png</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>The interface switches between the two views.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s the source for the aggregate index view:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TasksIndexView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: JST['tasks/tasks_index'],
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'tasks',

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "render");

    this.collection.bind("change", this.render);
    this.collection.bind("add",    this.render);
    this.collection.bind("remove", this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template({tasks: this.collection}));
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>and the source for the individual task detail view:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TaskDetail = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: JST['tasks/task_detail'],
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'task',

  events: {
    "click .comments .form-inputs button": "createComment"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "render");

    this.model.on("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.on("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.on("add",    this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template({task: this.model}));
  },

  createComment: function() {
    var comment = new Comment({ text: this.$('.new-comment-input').val() });
    this.$('.new-comment-input').val('');
    this.model.comments.create(comment);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Each task on the index page links to the detail view for itself. When a user
follows one of these links and navigates from the index page to the detail
page, then interacts with the detail view to change a model, the <literal>change</literal> event
on the <literal>TaskApp.tasks</literal> collection is fired. One consequence of this is that
the index view, which is still bound and observing the <literal>change</literal> event, will
re-render itself.</simpara>
<simpara>This is both a functional bug and a memory leak: not only will the index view
re-render and disrupt the detail display momentarily, but navigating back and
forth between the views without disposing of the previous view will keep
creating more views and binding more events on the associated models or
collections.</simpara>
<simpara>These can be extremely tricky to track down on a production application,
especially if you are nesting child views. Sadly, there&#8217;s no "garbage
collection" for views in Backbone, so your application needs to manage this
itself.  Luckily, it&#8217;s not too hard to keep track of and correctly maintain our
bindings.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take a look at how to unbind three kinds of events: DOM events, model
and collection events, and events you trigger in your views.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_unbinding_dom_events">
<title>Unbinding DOM events</title>
<simpara>DOM events are the simple case - they more or less get cleaned up for you.
When you call <literal>this.remove()</literal> in your view, it delegates to <literal>jQuery.remove()</literal>
by invoking <literal>$(this.el).remove()</literal>.  This means that jQuery takes care of
cleaning up any events bound on DOM elements within your view, regardless of
whether you bound them with the Backbone <literal>events</literal> hash or by hand; for example,
with <literal>$.bind()</literal>, <literal>$.delegate()</literal>, <literal>live()</literal> or <literal>$.on()</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_unbinding_model_and_collection_events">
<title>Unbinding model and collection events</title>
<simpara>If your view binds to events on a model or collection with <literal>on()</literal>, you are
responsible for unbinding these events.  You do this with a simple call to
<literal>this.model.off()</literal> or <literal>this.collection.off()</literal>; the
<ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Events-off"><literal>Backbone.Events.off()</literal>
function</ulink> removes all callbacks on that object.</simpara>
<simpara>When should we unbind these handlers?  Whenever the view is going away.  This
means that any pieces of code that create new instances of this view become
responsible for cleaning up after it&#8217;s gone. That isn&#8217;t a very cohesive
approach, so let&#8217;s include the cleanup responsibility on the view itself.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s write a <literal>leave()</literal> function on our view that wraps <literal>remove()</literal> and handles
any additional event unbinding we need to do.  As a convention, when we use
this view elsewhere, we&#8217;ll call <literal>leave()</literal> instead of <literal>remove()</literal> when we&#8217;re
done:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var SomeCollectionView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // snip...

  initialize: function() {
    this.collection.bind("change", this.render);
  },

  leave: function() {
    this.collection.unbind("change", this.render);
    this.remove();
  }

  // snip...
});</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_keep_track_of_literal_on_literal_calls_to_unbind_more_easily">
<title>Keep track of <literal>on()</literal> calls to unbind more easily</title>
<simpara>In the example above, unbinding the collection change event isn&#8217;t too much
hassle; since we&#8217;re only observing one thing, we only have to unbind one
thing.  But even the addition of one line to <literal>leave()</literal> is easy to forget, and
if you bind to multiple events then it only gets more verbose.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s add a step of indirection in event binding so that we can automatically
clean up all the events with one call.  We&#8217;ll add and use a <literal>bindTo()</literal>
function that keeps track of all the event handlers we bind, and then issue a
single call to <literal>unbindFromAll()</literal> to unbind them:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var SomeCollectionView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.bindings = [];
    this.bindTo(this.collection, "change", this.render);
  },

  leave: function() {
    this.unbindFromAll();
    this.remove();
  },

  bindTo: function(source, event, callback) {
    source.on(event, callback, this);
    this.bindings.push({ source: source, event: event, callback: callback });
  },

  unbindFromAll: function() {
    _.each(this.bindings, function(binding) {
      binding.source.off(binding.event, binding.callback);
    });
    this.bindings = [];
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>These functions, <literal>bindTo()</literal> and <literal>unbindFromAll()</literal>, can be extracted into a
reusable mixin or superclass.  Then, we just have to use <literal>bindTo()</literal> instead of
<literal>model.on()</literal> and be assured that the handlers will be cleaned up during
<literal>leave()</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_unbinding_view_triggered_events">
<title>Unbinding view-triggered events</title>
<simpara>With the first two kinds of event binding that we discussed, DOM and
model/collection, the view is the observer.  The responsibility to clean up is
on the observer, and here the responsibility consists of unbinding the event
handler when the view is being removed.</simpara>
<simpara>But other times, our view classes will trigger (emit) events of their own.  In
this case, other objects are the observer, and are responsible for cleaning up
the event binding when they are disposed.  See "Events Your View Publishes" in
the earlier "Event Binding" section for more details.</simpara>
<simpara>However, additionally, when the view itself is disposed of with <literal>leave()</literal>, it
should clean up any event handlers bound on <emphasis role="strong">itself</emphasis> for events that it
triggers.</simpara>
<simpara>This is handled by invoking <literal>Backbone.Events.off()</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var FilteringView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // snip...

  events: {
    "click a.filter": "changeFilter"
  },

  changeFilter: function() {
    if (someLogic()) {
      this.trigger("filtered", { some: options });
    }
  },

  leave: function() {
    this.off(); // Clean up any event handlers bound on this view
    this.remove();
  }

  // snip...
});</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_establish_a_convention_for_consistent_and_correct_unbinding">
<title>Establish a convention for consistent and correct unbinding</title>
<simpara>There&#8217;s no built-in garbage collection for Backbone&#8217;s event bindings, and
forgetting to unbind can cause bugs and memory leaks. The solution is to make
sure you unbind events and remove views when you leave them. Our approach to
this is two-fold: write a set of reusable functions that manage cleaning up a
view&#8217;s bindings, and use these functions whereever views are instantiated: in
<literal>Router</literal> instances, and in composite views.  We&#8217;ll take a look at these
concrete, reusable approaches in the next two sections about <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>
and <literal>CompositeView</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_swapping_router">
<title>Swapping router</title>
<simpara>When switching from one view to another, we should clean up the previous view.
We discussed previously a convention of writing a <literal>view.leave()</literal>
Let&#8217;s augment our view to include the ability to clean itself up by "leaving"
the DOM:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // ...

  leave: function() {
    this.off();
    this.remove();
  },

  // ...
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>off()</literal> and <literal>remove()</literal> functions are provided by <literal>Backbone.Events</literal> and
<literal>Backbone.View</literal> respectively. <literal>Backbone.Events.off()</literal> will remove all
callbacks registered on the view, and <literal>remove()</literal> will remove the view&#8217;s
element from the DOM, equivalent to calling <literal>this.$el.remove()</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>In simple cases, we replace one full page view with another full page (less any
shared layout). We introduce a convention that all actions underneath one
<literal>Router</literal> share the same root element, and define it as <literal>el</literal> on the router.</simpara>
<simpara>Now, a <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> can take advantage of the <literal>leave()</literal> function, and clean
up any existing views before swapping to a new one.  It swaps into a new view by
rendering that view into its own <literal>el</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">Support.SwappingRouter = function(options) {
  Backbone.Router.apply(this, [options]);
};

_.extend(Support.SwappingRouter.prototype, Backbone.Router.prototype, {
  swap: function(newView) {
    if (this.currentView &amp;&amp; this.currentView.leave) {
      this.currentView.leave();
    }

    this.currentView = newView;
    this.currentView.render();
    $(this.el).empty().append(this.currentView.el);
  }
});

Support.SwappingRouter.extend = Backbone.Router.extend;</programlisting>
<simpara>Now all you need to do in a route function is call <literal>swap()</literal>, passing in the
new view that should be rendered. The <literal>swap()</literal> function&#8217;s job is to call
<literal>leave()</literal> on the current view, render the new view appending it to the
router&#8217;s <literal>el</literal>, and finally store who the current view is, so that next time
<literal>swap()</literal> is invoked, it can be properly cleaned up as well.</simpara>
<section id="swapping-internals">
<title>SwappingRouter and Backbone internals</title>
<simpara>If the code for <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> seems a little confusing, don&#8217;t fret: it is,
thanks to JavaScript&#8217;s object model! Sadly, it&#8217;s not as simple to just drop in
the <literal>swap</literal> method into <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>, or call <literal>Backbone.Router.extend</literal> to
mixin the function we need.</simpara>
<simpara>Our goal here is essentially to create a subclass of <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>, and to
extend it without modifying the original class. This gives us a few benefits:
first, <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> should work with Backbone upgrades. Second, it should be
<emphasis role="strong">obvious</emphasis> and <emphasis role="strong">intention-revealing</emphasis> when a controller needs to swap views. If
we chose to just mix in a <literal>swap</literal> method, and called it from a direct descendant
of <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>, an unaware (and unlucky) programmer now needs to go on a
deep source dive in an attempt to figure out where that&#8217;s coming from. At least
with a subclass, the hunt should start at the file where it was defined.</simpara>
<simpara>The procedure used to create <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> is onerous thanks to a mix of
Backbone-isms and just how clunky inheritance is in JavaScript. First off, we
need to define the constructor, which delegates to the <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>
constructor with the use of <literal>Function#apply</literal>. The next block of code uses
Underscore&#8217;s <literal>Object#extend</literal> to create the set of functions and properties that
will become <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>. The <literal>extend</literal> function takes a destination, in
this case the empty prototype for <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>, and copies in the
properties in the <literal>Backbone.Router</literal> prototype along with our new custom object
that includes the <literal>swap</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, the subclass cake is topped off with some Backbone frosting: setting
<literal>extend</literal>, which is a self-propagating function that all Backbone public classes
use. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at this function, as of Backbone 0.5.3:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var extend = function (protoProps, classProps) {
  var child = inherits(this, protoProps, classProps);
  child.extend = this.extend;
  return child;
};

// Helper function to correctly set up the prototype chain, for subclasses.
// Similar to `goog.inherits`, but uses a hash of prototype properties and
// class properties to be extended.
var inherits = function(parent, protoProps, staticProps) {
  // sparing our readers the internals of this function... for a deep dive
  // into the dark realms of JavaScript's prototype system, read the source!
}</programlisting>
<simpara>So, it&#8217;s a function that calls <literal>inherits</literal> to make a new subclass.  The comments
reference <literal>goog.inherits</literal> from Google&#8217;s Closure Library, which contains similar
utility functions to allow more class-style inheritance.</simpara>
<simpara>The end result here is that whenever you make a custom controller, internally
in Backbone, you&#8217;re making <emphasis role="strong">another</emphasis> subclass. The inheritance chain for
<literal>TasksRouter</literal> would then look like:</simpara>

<simpara>Phew! Hopefully this adventure into Backbone and JavaScript internals has
taught you that although it&#8217;s more code, it&#8217;s hopefully going to save time down
the road for those maintaining your code.</simpara>
<simpara>You can find an example of a <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> on the example app under
<literal>app/assets/javascripts/routers/tasks.js</literal>. Note how each of the actions
in that Router use <literal>SwappingRouter.swap()</literal> to invoke rendering of views,
freeing itself from the complexities of cleaning them up.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_composite_views">
<title>Composite views</title>
<simpara>The <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> above calls <literal>leave()</literal> on the view it currently holds.
This function is not part of Backbone itself, and is part of our extension
library to help make views more modular and maintainable. This section goes
over the Composite View pattern, the <literal>CompositeView</literal> class itself, and some
concerns to keep in mind while creating your views.</simpara>
<section id="_refactoring_from_a_large_view">
<title>Refactoring from a large view</title>
<simpara>One of the first refactorings you find yourself doing in a non-trivial Backbone
app is splitting up large views into composable parts. Let&#8217;s take another look
at the <literal>TaskDetail</literal> source code from the beginning of this section:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TaskDetail = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: JST['tasks/task_detail'],
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'task',

  events: {
    "click .comments .form-inputs button": "createComment"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "render");

    this.model.on("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.on("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.on("add",    this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template({task: this.model}));
  },

  createComment: function() {
    var comment = new Comment({ text: this.$('.new-comment-input').val() });
    this.$('.new-comment-input').val('');
    this.model.comments.create(comment);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The view class references a template, which renders out the HTML for this page:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">include::task_detail.html.jst</programlisting>
<simpara>There are clearly several concerns going on here: rendering the task, rendering
the comments that folks have left, and rendering the form to create new
comments. Let&#8217;s separate those concerns. A first approach might be to just
break up the template files:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/show.jst --&gt;
&lt;section class="task-details"&gt;
  &lt;%= JST['tasks/details']({ task: task }) %&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class="comments"&gt;
  &lt;%= JST['comments/list']({ task: task }) %&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/details.jst --&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"&lt;%= task.isComplete() ? ' checked="checked"' : '' %&gt; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= task.escape("title") %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/list.jst --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;% task.comments.each(function(comment) { %&gt;
    &lt;%= JST['comments/item']({ comment: comment }) %&gt;
  &lt;% } %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;%= JST['comments/new']() %&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/item.jst --&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;%= comment.user.escape('name') %&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= comment.escape('text') %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/new.jst --&gt;
&lt;div class="form-inputs"&gt;
  &lt;label for="new-comment-input"&gt;Add comment&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;textarea id="new-comment-input" cols="30" rows="10"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Add Comment&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>But this is really only half the story. The <literal>TaskDetail</literal> view class still
handles multiple concerns: displaying the task, and creating comments. Let&#8217;s
split that view class up, using the <literal>CompositeView</literal> base class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">Support.CompositeView = function(options) {
  this.children = _([]);
  Backbone.View.apply(this, [options]);
};

_.extend(Support.CompositeView.prototype, Backbone.View.prototype, {
  leave: function() {
    this.unbind();
    this.remove();
    this._leaveChildren();
    this._removeFromParent();
  },

  renderChild: function(view) {
    view.render();
    this.children.push(view);
    view.parent = this;
  },

  appendChild: function(view) {
    this.renderChild(view);
    $(this.el).append(view.el);
  },

  renderChildInto: function(view, container) {
    this.renderChild(view);
    $(container).empty().append(view.el);
  },

  _leaveChildren: function() {
    this.children.chain().clone().each(function(view) {
      if (view.leave)
        view.leave();
    });
  },

  _removeFromParent: function() {
    if (this.parent)
      this.parent._removeChild(this);
  },

  _removeChild: function(view) {
    var index = this.children.indexOf(view);
    this.children.splice(index, 1);
  }
});

Support.CompositeView.extend = Backbone.View.extend;</programlisting>
<simpara>Similar to the <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>, the <literal>CompositeView</literal> base class solves common
housekeeping problems by establishing a convention. See the "SwappingRouter and
Backbone internals" section for an in-depth analysis of how this subclassing
pattern works.</simpara>
<simpara>Now our <literal>CompositeView</literal> maintains an array of its immediate children as
<literal>this.children</literal>.  With this reference in place, a parent view&#8217;s <literal>leave()</literal> method
can invoke <literal>leave()</literal> on its children, ensuring that an entire tree of composed
views is cleaned up properly.</simpara>
<simpara>For child views that can dismiss themselves, such as dialog boxes, children
maintain a back-reference at <literal>this.parent</literal>. This is used to reach up and call
<literal>this.parent.removeChild(this)</literal> for these self-dismissing views.</simpara>
<simpara>Making use of <literal>CompositeView</literal>, we split up the <literal>TaskDetail</literal> view class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TaskDetail = CompositeView.extend({
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'task',

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "renderDetails");
    this.model.on("change", this.renderDetails);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.renderLayout();
    this.renderDetails();
    this.renderCommentsList();
  },

  renderLayout: function() {
    this.$el.html(JST['tasks/show']());
  },

  renderDetails: function() {
    var detailsMarkup = JST['tasks/details']({ task: this.model });
    this.$('.task-details').html(detailsMarkup);
  },

  renderCommentsList: function() {
    var commentsList = new CommentsList({ model: this.model });
    var commentsContainer = this.$('comments');
    this.renderChildInto(commentsList, commentsContainer);
  }
});</programlisting>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var CommentsList = CompositeView.extend({
  tagName: 'ul',

  initialize: function() {
    this.model.comments.on("add", this.renderComments);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.renderLayout();
    this.renderComments();
    this.renderCommentForm();
  },

  renderLayout: function() {
    this.$el.html(JST['comments/list']());
  },

  renderComments: function() {
    var commentsContainer = this.$('comments-list');
    commentsContainer.html('');

    this.model.comments.each(function(comment) {
      var commentMarkup = JST['comments/item']({ comment: comment });
      commentsContainer.append(commentMarkup);
    });
  },

  renderCommentForm: function() {
    var commentForm = new CommentForm({ model: this.model });
    var commentFormContainer = this.$('.new-comment-form');
    this.renderChildInto(commentForm, commentFormContainer);
  }
});</programlisting>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var CommentForm = CompositeView.extend({
  events: {
    "click button": "createComment"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    this.model = this.options.model;
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(JST['comments/new']);
  },

  createComment: function() {
    var comment = new Comment({ text: $('.new-comment-input').val() });
    this.$('.new-comment-input').val('');
    this.model.comments.create(comment);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Along with this, remove the <literal>&lt;%= JST(&#8230;) %&gt;</literal> template nestings, allowing the
view classes to assemble the templates instead. In this case, each template
contains placeholder elements that are used to wrap child views:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/show.jst --&gt;
&lt;section class="task-details"&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class="comments"&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/details.jst --&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"&lt;%= task.isComplete() ? ' checked="checked"' : '' %&gt; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= task.escape("title") %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/list.jst --&gt;
&lt;ul class="comments-list"&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;section class="new-comment-form"&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/item.jst --&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;%= comment.user.escape('name') %&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= comment.escape('text') %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/new.jst --&gt;
&lt;label for="new-comment-input"&gt;Add comment&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;textarea class="new-comment-input" cols="30" rows="10"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;button&gt;Add Comment&lt;/button&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>There are several advantages to this approach:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Each view class has a smaller and more cohesive set of responsibilities.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The comments view code, extracted and decoupled from the task view code, can
  now be reused on other domain objects with comments.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The task view performs better, since adding new comments or updating the task
  details will only re-render the pertinent section, instead of re-rendering the
  entire task + comments composite.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the example app, we make use of a composite view on TasksIndex located at
<literal>app/assets/javascripts/views/tasks_index.js</literal>. The situation is similar to
what has been discussed here. The view responsible for rendering the list of
children will actually render them as children. Note how the <literal>renderTasks</literal>
function iterates over the  collection of tasks, instantiates a <literal>TaskItem</literal>
view for each, renders it as a child with <literal>renderChild</literal>, and finally appends
it to table&#8217;s body. Now when the router cleans up the <literal>TasksIndex</literal> with <literal>leave</literal>,
it will also clean up all of its children.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_cleaning_up_views_properly">
<title>Cleaning up views properly</title>
<simpara>You&#8217;ve learned how leaving lingering events bound on views that are no longer
on the page can cause both UI bugs, or what&#8217;s probably worse, memory leaks.
A slight flickering of the interface is annoying at best, but prolonged usage
of your app could in fact make the user&#8217;s browser to start consuming massive
amounts of memory, potentially causing browser crashes, data loss and unhappy
users and angry developers.</simpara>
<simpara>We now have a full set of tools to clean up views properly. To summarize, the
big picture tools are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A <emphasis role="strong">Swapping Router</emphasis> that keeps track of the current view so it can tell it
to clean up before it swaps in a new view.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A <emphasis role="strong">Composite View</emphasis> that keeps track of its child views so it can tell them to
clean up when it is cleaning itself up.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The <literal>leave()</literal> function ties this all together. A call to <literal>leave()</literal> can either
come from a <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> or from a parent <literal>CompositeView</literal>.  A <literal>CompositeView</literal>
will respond to <literal>leave()</literal> by passing that call down to its children. At each
level, in addition to propagating the call, <literal>leave()</literal> handles the task of
completely cleaning up after a view by removing the corresponding element from
the DOM via jQuery&#8217;s <literal>remove()</literal> function, and removing all event bindings via a
call to <literal>Backbone.Events.off()</literal>. In this way a single call at the top level
cleans the slate for an entirely new view.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_forms">
<title>Forms</title>
<simpara>Who likes writing form code by hand?  Rails' form builder API greatly helps
reduce application code.  We aim to maintain a similar level of abstraction in
our Backbone application code.  Let&#8217;s take a look at what we need from form
building code to achieve this.</simpara>
<simpara>We have a few requirements when it comes to handling forms.  We need to:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Build form markup and populate it with model values
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Serialize a form into a model for validation and persistence
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Display error messages
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Additionally, it&#8217;s nice to:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Reduce boilerplate
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Render consistent and stylable markup
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Automatically build form structure from data structure
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s look at the requirements one-by-one and compare approaches.</simpara>
<section id="_building_markup">
<title>Building markup</title>
<simpara>Our first requirement is the ability to build markup.  For example, consider a
Rails model <literal>User</literal> that has a username and password.  We might want to build
form markup that looks like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="email" name="email"&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="password" id="password" name="password"&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>One approach you could take is writing the full form markup by hand.  You could
create a template available to Backbone via JST that contains the raw HTML.  If
you took the above markup and saved it into <literal>app/templates/users/form.jst</literal> then
it would be accessible as <literal>JST["users/form"]()</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>You <emphasis role="strong">could</emphasis> write all the HTML by hand, but we&#8217;d like to avoid that.</simpara>
<simpara>Another route that might seem appealing is reusing the Rails form builders
through the 3.1 asset pipeline.  Consider <literal>app/templates/users/form.jst.ejs.erb</literal>
which is processed first with ERb, and then made available as a JST template.
There are a few concerns to address, such as including changing the EJS or ERb template
delimiters <literal>&lt;% %&gt;</literal> to not conflict and mixing the Rails helper modules into the
Tilt::ERbTemplate rendering context.  Yet, this approach still only generates
markup; it doesn&#8217;t serialize forms into data hashes or Backbone models.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_serializing_forms">
<title>Serializing forms</title>
<simpara>The second requirement is to serialize forms into objects suitable for setting
Backbone model attributes.  Assuming the markup we discussed above, you could
approach this manually:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var serialize = function(form) {
  var elements = $('input, select, textarea', form);

  var serializer = function(attributes, element) {
    var element = $(element);
    attributes[element.attr('name')] = element.val();
  };

  return _.inject(elements, serializer, []);
};

var form = $('form');
var model = new MyApp.Models.User();
var attributes = serialize(form);
model.set(attributes);</programlisting>
<simpara>This gets you started, but has a few shortcomings.  It doesn&#8217;t handle nested
attributes, doesn&#8217;t handle typing (consider a date picker input; ideally it
would set a Backbone model&#8217;s attribute to a JavaScript Date instance), and will
include any <literal>&lt;input type="submit"&gt;</literal> elements when constructing the attribute
hash.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_a_backbone_forms_library">
<title>A Backbone forms library</title>
<simpara>If you want to avoid writing form markup by hand, your best bet is to use a
JavaScript form builder.  Since the model data is being read and written by
Backbone views and models, it&#8217;s ideal to have markup construction and form
serialization implemented on the client-side.</simpara>
<simpara>One solid implementation is
<ulink url="https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms"><literal>backbone-forms</literal> by Charles
Davison</ulink>.  It provides markup construction and serialization, as well as a
method for declaring a typed schema to support both of those facilities.  It
provides a flexible system for adding custom editor types, and supports
configuring your form markup structure by providing HTML template fragments.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_display_server_errors">
<title>Display server errors</title>
<simpara>We are assuming, with a hybrid Rails/Backbone application, that at least some of
your business logic resides on the server.  Let&#8217;s take a look at the client/server
interaction when a user of the example application creates a task.</simpara>
<simpara>The client side interface for creating a new task is structure similarly to a
traditional Rails form.  Although moderated by Backbone views and models,
essentially there is a form whose contents is submitted to the Rails server,
where attributes are processed and a response is generated.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s add a validation to the Task Rails model, ensuring each task has something
entered for the title:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">  validates :title, :presence =&gt; true</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, if you create a task without a title, the Rails <literal>TasksController</literal> still
delivers a response:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def create
  respond_with(current_user.tasks.create(params[:task]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>but the response now returns with an HTTP response code of 422 and a JSON
response body of <literal>{"title":["can't be blank"]}</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>Establishing a few conventions, we can display these per-field errors alongside
their corresponding form inputs.  We&#8217;ll</simpara>
<simpara>We will establish a few conventions that, when we can adhere to them, allow us
to render the Rails validation errors inline on the form.  Depending on how you
structure markup in your application, you can employ a variation on this
approach.</simpara>
<simpara>For an example, let&#8217;s examine a form field modeled after Formtastic conventions:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;form id="example_form"&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id="task_title_input"&gt;
      &lt;label for="task_title"&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input id="task_title" name="title" type="text"&gt;
      &lt;!--
        &lt;p class="inline_errors"&gt;
          The error for this field will be rendered here.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      --&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Elsewhere, likely in a view class, when a user triggers a save action in the
interface, we save the form&#8217;s corresponding model.  If the <literal>save()</literal> fails,
we&#8217;ll parse the model attributes and corresponding error(s) from the server&#8217;s
response and render an <literal>ErrorView</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var formField = $('form#example_form');

model.on('error', function(model, response, options) {
  var attributesWithErrors = JSON.parse(response.responseText);

  new ErrorView({
    el: formField,
    attributesWithErrors: attributesWithErrors
  }).render();
});

model.save();</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>ErrorView</literal> iterates over the response attributes and their errors (there
may be more than one error per model attribute), rendering them inline into
the form.  The <literal>ErrorView</literal> also adds the <literal>error</literal> CSS class to the <literal>&lt;li&gt;</literal> field
container.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ErrorView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function(options) {
    this.attributesWithErrors = this.options.attributesWithErrors;
    _.bindAll(this, "clearErrors", "renderErrors", "renderError", "fieldFor");

<section id="_internationalization">
<title>Internationalization</title>
<simpara>When you move your application&#8217;s view logic onto the client, such as with
Backbone, you quickly find that the library support for views is not as
comprehensive as what you have on the server. The
<ulink url="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html">Rails internationalization (i18n) API</ulink>,
provided via the <ulink url="https://rubygems.org/gems/i18n">i18n gem</ulink>, is not automatically
available to client-side view rendering.  We&#8217;d like to take advantage of that
framework, as well as any localization work you&#8217;ve done if you are adding
Backbone into an existing app.</simpara>
<simpara>There is a JavaScript library, available with Rails support as a Ruby gem
<ulink url="https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js"><literal>i18n-js</literal></ulink>, that provides access to your i18n
content as a JavaScript object, similar to how the JST object provides access
to your templates.</simpara>
<simpara>From the documentation, you can link the locale to the server-side locale:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  I18n.defaultLocale = "&lt;%= I18n.default_locale %&gt;";
  I18n.locale = "&lt;%= I18n.locale %&gt;";
&lt;/script&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>and then use the <literal>I18n</literal> JavaScript object to provide translations:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">// translate with your default locale
I18n.t("some.scoped.translation");

// translate with explicit setting of locale
I18n.t("some.scoped.translation", {locale: "fr"});</programlisting>
<simpara>You can use the <literal>I18n.t()</literal> function inside your templates, too:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;a href="#/"&gt;&lt;%= I18n.t("nav.links.home") %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="#/projects"&gt;&lt;%= I18n.t("nav.links.projects") %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;a href="#/settings"&gt;&lt;%= I18n.t("nav.links.settings") %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;</programlisting>

<title>Models and collections</title>
<section id="_filters_and_sorting">
<title>Filters and sorting</title>
<simpara>When using our Backbone models and collections, it&#8217;s often handy to filter the
collections by reusable criteria, or sort them by several different criteria.</simpara>
<section id="_filters">
<title>Filters</title>
<simpara>To filter a <literal>Backbone.Collection</literal>, like with Rails named scopes, define
functions on your collections that filter by your criteria, using the <literal>select</literal>
function from Underscore.js, and return new instances of the collection class. A
first implementation might look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  complete: function() {
    var filteredTasks = this.select(function(task) {
      return task.get('completed_at') !== null;
    });
    return new Tasks(filteredTasks);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s refactor this a bit.  Ideally, the filter functions will reuse logic
already defined in your model class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  isComplete: function() {
    return this.get('completed_at') !== null;
  }
});

var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  complete: function() {
    var filteredTasks = this.select(function(task) {
      return task.isComplete();
    });
    return new Tasks(filteredTasks);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Going further, notice that there are actually two concerns in this function.
The first is the notion of filtering the collection, and the other is the
specific filtering criteria (<literal>task.isComplete()</literal>).</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s separate the two concerns here, and extract a <literal>filtered</literal> function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  isComplete: function() {
    return this.get('completed_at') !== null;
  }
});

var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  complete: function() {
    return this.filtered(function(task) {
      return task.isComplete();
    });
  },

  filtered: function(criteriaFunction) {
    return new Tasks(this.select(criteriaFunction));
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>We can extract this function into a reusable mixin, abstracting the <literal>Tasks</literal>
collection class using <literal>this.constructor</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var FilterableCollectionMixin = {
  filtered: function(criteriaFunction) {
    return new this.constructor(this.select(criteriaFunction));
  }
};

var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  isComplete: function() {
    return this.get('completed_at') !== null;
  }
});

var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  complete: function() {
    return this.filtered(function(task) {
      return task.isComplete();
    });
  }
});

_.extend(Tasks.prototype, FilterableCollectionMixin);</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_propagating_collection_changes">
<title>Propagating collection changes</title>
<simpara>The <literal>FilterableCollectionMixin</literal>, as we&#8217;ve written it, will produce a filtered
collection that does not update when the original collection is changed.  To do
so, bind to the change, add, and remove events on the source collection,
reapply the filter function, and repopulate the filtered collection:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var FilterableCollectionMixin = {
  filtered: function(criteriaFunction) {
    var sourceCollection = this;
    var filteredCollection = new this.constructor;

    var applyFilter = function() {
      filteredCollection.reset(sourceCollection.select(criteriaFunction));
    };

    this.bind("change", applyFilter);
    this.bind("add",    applyFilter);
    this.bind("remove", applyFilter);

    applyFilter();

    return filteredCollection;
  }
};</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_sorting">
<title>Sorting</title>
<simpara>The simplest way to sort a <literal>Backbone.Collection</literal> is to define a <literal>comparator</literal>
function.  This functionality is built in:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  comparator: function(task) {
    return task.dueDate;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>If you&#8217;d like to provide more than one sort order on your collection, you can
use an approach similar to the <literal>filtered</literal> function above, and return a new
<literal>Backbone.Collection</literal> whose <literal>comparator</literal> is overridden.  Call <literal>sort</literal> to update
the ordering on the new collection:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  comparator: function(task) {
    return task.dueDate;
  },

  byCreatedAt: function() {
    var sortedCollection = new Tasks(this.models);
    sortedCollection.comparator = function(task) {
      return task.createdAt;
    };
    sortedCollection.sort();
    return sortedCollection;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Similarly, you can extract the reusable concern to another function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  comparator: function(task) {
    return task.dueDate;
  },

  byCreatedAt: function() {
    return this.sortedBy(function(task) {
      return task.createdAt;
    });
  },

  byCompletedAt: function() {
    return this.sortedBy(function(task) {
      return task.completedAt;
    });
  },

  sortedBy: function(comparator) {
    var sortedCollection = new Tasks(this.models);
    sortedCollection.comparator = comparator;
    sortedCollection.sort();
    return sortedCollection;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>And then into another reusable mixin:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var SortableCollectionMixin = {
  sortedBy: function(comparator) {
    var sortedCollection = new this.constructor(this.models);
    sortedCollection.comparator = comparator;
    sortedCollection.sort();
    return sortedCollection;
  }
};

var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  comparator: function(task) {
    return task.dueDate;
  },

  byCreatedAt: function() {
    return this.sortedBy(function(task) {
      return task.createdAt;
    });
  },

  byCompletedAt: function() {
    return this.sortedBy(function(task) {
      return task.completedAt;
    });
  }
});

_.extend(Tasks.prototype, SortableCollectionMixin);</programlisting>
<simpara>Just as with the <literal>FilterableCollectionMixin</literal> before, the
<literal>SortableCollectionMixin</literal> should observe its source if updates are to propagate
from one collection to another:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var SortableCollectionMixin = {
  sortedBy: function(comparator) {
    var sourceCollection = this;
    var sortedCollection = new this.constructor;
    sortedCollection.comparator = comparator;

    var applySort = function() {
      sortedCollection.reset(sourceCollection.models);
      sortedCollection.sort();
    };

    this.on("change", applySort);
    this.on("add",    applySort);
    this.on("remove", applySort);

    applySort();

    return sortedCollection;
  }
};</programlisting>

<section id="_validations">
<title>Validations</title>
<simpara>The server is the authoritative place for verifying whether data that being
stored is valid. Even though backbone.js
<ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model-validate">exposes an API</ulink>
for performing client side validations, when it comes to validating user data
in a backbone.js application we want to continue to use the very same
mechanisms on the server side that we&#8217;ve used in Rails all along: the
ActiveModel validations API.</simpara>
<simpara>The challenge is tying the two together: letting your ActiveRecord objects
reject invalid user data, and having the errors bubble up all the way to the
interface for user feedback - and having it all be seamless to the user and
easy for the developer.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s wire this up. To get started, we&#8217;ll add a validation on the task&#8217;s title
attribute on the ActiveRecord model like so:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Task &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :title, presence: true
end</programlisting>
<simpara>On the backbone side of the world, we have a Backbone task called
YourApp.Models.Task:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">YourApp.Models.Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  urlRoot: '/tasks'
});</programlisting>
<simpara>We also have a place where users enter new tasks - just a form on the task
list.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li class="task_title_input"&gt;
      &lt;label for="title"&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input id="title" maxlength="255" name="title" type="text"&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;button class="submit" id="create-task"&gt;Create task&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>On the NewTask backbone view, we bind the button&#8217;s click event to a new
function that we&#8217;ll call <literal>createTask</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">YourApp.Views.NewTask = Backbone.View.extend({
  events: {
    "click #create-task": "createTask"
  },

  createTask: {
    // grab attribute values from the form
    // storing them on the attributes hash
    var attributes = {};
    _.each(this.$('form input, form select'), function(element) {
      var element = $(element);
      if(element.attr('name') != "commit") {
        attributes[element.attr('name')] = element.val();
      }
    });

    var self = this;
    // create a new task and save it to the server
    new YourApp.Models.Task(attributes).save({
        success: function() { /* handle success */ }
        error:   function() { /* validation error occurred, show user */ }
      });
    return false;
  }
})</programlisting>
<simpara>This gets the job done, but let&#8217;s introduce a new class to handle extracting
attributes from the form so that it&#8217;s decoupled from this view and it&#8217;s
therefore easier to extend and reuse.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll call this the <literal>FormAttributes</literal>, and its code is like follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">FormAttributes = function(form) {
  this.form = form;
}

_.extend(FormAttributes.prototype, {
  attributes: function() {
    var attributes = {};
    _.each($('input, select', this.form), function(element) {
      var element = $(element);
      if(element.attr('name') != "commit") {
        attributes[element.attr('name')] = element.val();
      }
    });
    return attributes;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>With this class in place, we can rewrite our form submit action to:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">YourApp.Views.NewTask = Backbone.View.extend({
  events: {
    "click #create-task": "createTask"
  },

  createTask: {
    var attributes = new FormAttributes(this.$('form')).attributes();

    var self = this;
    // create a new task and save it to the server
    new YourApp.Models.Task(attributes).save({
        success: function() { /* handle success */ }
        error:   function() { /* validation error occurred, show user */ }
      });
    return false;
  }
})</programlisting>
<simpara>When you call save() on a backbone model, Backbone will delegate to <literal>.sync()</literal>
and create a POST request on the model&#8217;s URL where the payload are the
attributes that you&#8217;ve passed onto the <literal>save()</literal> call.</simpara>
<simpara>The easiest way to handle this in Rails is to use respond_to/respond_with
available in Rails 3 applciations:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController
  respond_to :json
  def create
    task = Task.create(params)
    respond_with task
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>When the task is created successfully, Rails will render the show action using
the object that you&#8217;ve passed to the respond_with call, so make sure the show
action is defined in your routes:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">resources :tasks, only: [:create, :show]</programlisting>
<simpara>When the task cannot be created successfully because some validation constraint
is not met, the the Rails responder will render the model&#8217;s errors as a JSON
object, and use an HTTP status code of 422, which will alert backbone that
there was an error in the request and it was not processed.</simpara>
<simpara>The response from Rails in that case looks something like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">{ "title": ["can't be blank"] }</programlisting>
<simpara>So that two line action in a Rails controller is all we need to talk to our
backbone models and handle error cases.</simpara>
<simpara>Back to the backbone model&#8217;s <literal>save()</literal> call, Backbone will invoke one of two
callbacks when it receives a response from the rails app, so we simply pass in
a hash containing a function to run both for the success and the error cases.</simpara>
<simpara>In the success case, we may want to add the new model instance to a global
collection of tasks. Backbone will trigger the add event on that collection, so
there&#8217;s your chance for some other view to bind to that event and rerender
itself so that the new task appears on the page.</simpara>
<simpara>In the error case, however, we want to display inline errors on the form. When
backbone triggers the <literal>error</literal> callback, it passes along two parameters: the
model being saved and the raw response. We have to parse the JSON response and
iterate through it rendering an inline error on the form corresponding to each
of the errors. Let&#8217;s introduce a couple of new classes that will help along the
way.</simpara>
<simpara>First off is the <literal>ErrorList</literal>. An <literal>ErrorList</literal> encapsulates parsing of the raw
JSON that came in from the server and provides an iterator to easily loop
through errors:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ErrorList = function (response) {
  if (response &amp;&amp; response.responseText) {
    this.attributesWithErrors = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
  }
};

_.extend(ErrorList.prototype, {
  each: function (iterator) {
    _.each(attributesWithErrors, iterator);
  },

  size: function() {
    return _.size(attributesWithErrors);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Next up is the <literal>ErrorView</literal>, who&#8217;s in charge of taking the Errorlist and
appending each inline error in the form, providing feedback to the user that
their input is invalid.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ErrorView = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "renderError");
  },

  render: function() {
    this.$(".error").removeClass("error");
    this.$("p.inline-errors").remove();
    this.options.errors.each(this.renderError);
  },

  renderError: function(errors, attribute) {
    var errorString = errors.join(", ");
    var field = this.fieldFor(attribute);
    var errorTag = $('&lt;p&gt;').addClass('inline-errors').text(errorString);
    field.append(errorTag);
    field.addClass("error");
  },

  fieldFor: function(attribute) {
    return $(this.options.el).find('[id*="_' + attribute + '_input"]').first();
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Note the <literal>fieldFor</literal> function. It expects a field with an id containing a
certain format. Therefore, in order for this to work the form&#8217;s HTML must
contain a matching element. In our case, it was the list item with an id of
<literal>task_title_input</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>When a backbone view&#8217;s <literal>el</literal> is already on the DOM, we need to pass it into the
view&#8217;s constructor. In the case of the <literal>ErrorView</literal> class, we want to operate on
the view that contains the form that originated the errors.</simpara>
<simpara>To use these classes, we take the response from the server and pass that along
to the ErrorList constructor, which we then pass to the ErrorView that will do
it&#8217;s fine job in inserting the inline errors when we call <literal>render()</literal> on it.
Putting it all together, our save call&#8217;s callbacks now look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var self = this;
var model = new YourApp.Models.Task(attributes);
model.save({
  error: function(model, response) {
    var errors = new ErrorList(response);
    var view   = new ErrorView( { el: self.el, errors: errors } );
    view.render();
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Here we&#8217;ve shown how you can decouple different concerns into their own
classes, creating a system that is easier to extend, and potentially
arriving at generic enough solutions to be even shared across applications.
Our simple FormAttributes class has a long way to go. It can grow up to handle
many other cases such as dates.</simpara>
<simpara>One example of a generic library that handles much of what we&#8217;ve done here,
as well as helpers for rendering the forms, is Backbone.Form. In order to know
how to render all attributes of a model, it requires you to specify a
"schema" on the model class - and it will take it from there. The source for
Backbone.Form can be found
<ulink url="https://github.com/powmedia/backbone-forms">on github</ulink>.</simpara>

<section id="_model_relationships">
<title>Model relationships</title>
<simpara>In any non-trivial application, you will have relationships in your domain model
that are valuable to express on the client side.  For example, consider a
contact management application where each person in your contact list has many
phone numbers, each of a different kind.</simpara>
<simpara>Or, consider a project planning application where there are Teams, Members, and
Projects as resources (models and collections).  There are relationships between
each of these primary resources, and those relationships in turn may be exposed
as first-class resources: a Membership to link a Team and a Member, or a
Permission to link a Team with a Project.  These relationships are often exposed
as first-class models so they can be created and destroyed the same way as other
models, and so that additional domain information about the relationship, such
as a duration, rate, or quantity, can be described.</simpara>
<simpara>These model relationships don&#8217;t have to be persisted by a relational database.
In a chatroom application whose data is persisted in a key-value store, the data
could still be modeled as a Room which has many Messages, as well as Memberships
that link the Room to Users.  A content management application that stores its
data in a document database still has the notion of hierarchy, where a Site
contains many Pages, each of which is constitutes of zero or more Sections.</simpara>
<simpara>In a vanilla Rails application, the object model is described on the server side
with ActiveRecord subclasses, and exposed to the Backbone client through a
JSON HTTP API.  You have a few choices to make when designing this API, largely
focused on the inherent coupling of model relationships and data&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;when you handle a request for one resource, which of its associated resources
(if any) do you deliver, too?</simpara>
<simpara>Then, on the client side, you have a wide degree of choice in how to model the
relationships, when to eagerly pre-fetch associations and when to lazily defer
loading, and whether to employ a supporting library to help define your model
relationships.</simpara>
<section id="_backbone_relational_plugin">
<title>Backbone-relational plugin</title>
<simpara>If your use cases are supported by it, Paul Uithol&#8217;s
<ulink url="https://github.com/PaulUithol/Backbone-relational">Backbone-relational</ulink> is
arguably the most popular and actively maintained library for this.  It lets
you declare one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relations on your Backbone
models by extending a new base class, <literal>Backbone.RelationalModel</literal>.  It&#8217;s good to
understand how this works under the hood, so we&#8217;ll cover one way to implement a
relational object model in Backbone below, but we encourage you to check out
the <literal>Backbone-relational</literal> plugin as a way to work at a higher level of
abstraction.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_relations_in_the_task_app">
<title>Relations in the Task App</title>
<simpara>In the example application, there are Users which have many Tasks.  Each Task
has many Attachments and Assignments.  Tasks are assigned to Users through
Assignments, so tasks have many assigned users as well.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_deciding_how_to_deliver_data_to_the_client">
<title>Deciding how to deliver data to the client</title>
<simpara>Before you decide how to model your JSON API or how to declare your client-side model
relationships, step back and consider the user experience of your application.
For TaskApp, we decided to have interactions as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A user signs up or logs in
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The user is directed to their dashboard
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The dashboard shows all tasks, including assigned users, but without attachments.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
When a user views the details of an individual task, the attachments for that task are displayed.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>This leads us to see that a user&#8217;s Tasks and their assignees are used
immediately upon navigating to the dashboard, but the Attachment data for a
Task are not needed upon initial page load, and are possibly never needed at
all.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say that we are also planning for the user to have continuous network
access, but not to necessarily have a high speed connection.  Also, users tend
to view their list of tasks frequently, but rarely view the attachments.</simpara>
<simpara>Based on this, we will bootstrap the collections of Tasks and assignees inside the
dashboard, and defer loading of associated Attachments until after
the user clicks through to a task.</simpara>
<simpara>We could have selected from several other alternatives, including:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Don&#8217;t preload any information, and deliver only static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
  on the dashboard request.  Fetch all resources over separate XHR calls.  This
  can provide for a faster initial page load, at the cost of a longer time to
  actual interactivity: although the byte size of the page plus data is roughly
  the same, the overhead of additional HTTP requests incurs the extra load time.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Preload all the information, including Attachments.  This would
  work well if we expected users to frequently access the
  attachments of many tasks, but incurs a longer initial page load.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Use localStorage as the primary storage engine, and sync to the Rails server
  in the background.  This would be advantageous if we expected network access
  to be intermittent, although it incurs the additional complexity of having to
  resolve conflicts on the server if two clients submit conflicting updates.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section id="_designing_the_http_json_api">
<title>Designing the HTTP JSON API</title>
<simpara>Now that we know we&#8217;ll bootstrap the tasks with assignees and defer the
Associations, we should decide how to deliver the deferred content.  Our goal
is to fetch attachments for an individual task.  Let&#8217;s discuss two options.</simpara>
<simpara>One way we could approach this is to issue an API call for the
nested collection:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ curl http://localhost:3000/tasks/78/attachments.json | ppjson
[
  {
    "id": "32",
    "file_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tasksapp/uploads/32/mock.png"
  },
  {
    "id": "33",
    "file_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tasksapp/uploads/33/users.jpg"
  }
]</programlisting>
<note><simpara>We will authenticate API requests with cookies, just like normal user
login, so the actual curl request would need to include a cookie from a logged
in user.</simpara></note>
<simpara>Another way we could approach this is to embed the comment and attachment data in
the JSON representation of an individual task, and deliver this data from the
<literal>/tasks/:id</literal> endpoint:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ curl http://tasksapp.local:3000/tasks/78.json | ppjson
{
  /* some attributes left out for clarity */

  "id": 78,
  "user_id": 1,
  "title": "Clean up landing page",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "id": "32",
      "upload_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tasksapp/uploads/32/mock.png"
    }
  ]
}</programlisting>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll take this approach for the example application, because it illustrates
parsing nested models in Backbone.</simpara>
<simpara>At this point, we know that our HTTP JSON API should support at least the
following Rails routes:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">resources :tasks, :only =&gt; [:show, :create] do
  resources :attachments, :only =&gt; [:create]
end</programlisting>
<simpara>As an aside: in some applications, you choose to expose a user-facing API.  It&#8217;s
valuable to dogfood this endpoint by making use of it from your own Backbone
code.  Often these APIs will be scoped under an "/api" namespace, possibly with
an API version namespace as well like "/api/v1".</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_implementing_the_api_presenting_the_json">
<title>Implementing the API: presenting the JSON</title>
<simpara>For building the JSON presentation, we have a few options. Rails already comes
with support for overriding the <literal>Task#as_json</literal> method, which is probably the
easiest thing to do. However, logic regarding the JSON representation of a
model is not the model&#8217;s concern.  An approach that separates presentation
logic is preferable, such as creating a separate presenter object, or writing a
builder-like view.</simpara>
<simpara>The <ulink url="https://github.com/nesquena/rabl">RABL gem</ulink> helps you concisely build
a view of your models, and keeps this logic in the presentation tier.</simpara>
<simpara>RABL allows you to create templates where you can easily specify the JSON
representation of your models. If you&#8217;ve worked with the <literal>builder</literal>
library to generate XML such as an RSS feed, you&#8217;ll feel right at home.</simpara>
<simpara>To use it, first include the <literal>rabl</literal> and <literal>yajl-ruby</literal> gems in your Gemfile. Then
you can create a view ending with <literal>.json.rabl</literal> to handle any particular request.
For example, a tasks#show action may look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController
  respond_to :json

  def show
    @task = Task.find(params[:id])
    respond_with @task
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Rails responders will first look for a template matching the controller/action
with the format in the file name, in this case <literal>json</literal>. If it doesn&#8217;t find it,
it will invoke <literal>to_json</literal> on the <literal>@task</literal> model, but in this case we are providing
one in <literal>app/views/tasks/show.json.rabl</literal>, so it will render that instead:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">object @task
attributes(:id, :title, :complete)
child(:user) { attributes(:id, :email) }
child(:attachments) { attributes(:id, :email) }</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_parsing_the_json_and_instantiating_client_side_models">
<title>Parsing the JSON and instantiating client-side models</title>
<simpara>Now that our API delivers the <literal>Task</literal> JSON to the client, including its
nested <literal>Attachments</literal>, we need to correctly handle this nested data in the
client-side model.  Instead of a nested hash of attributes on the
<literal>Task</literal>, we want to instantiate a Backbone collection for the
attachments that contains a set of Backbone <literal>Attachment</literal> models.</simpara>
<simpara>The JSON for the attachments is initially set on the Backbone <literal>Task</literal> model as a
Backbone attribute which can be accessed with <literal>get()</literal> and <literal>set()</literal>.  We are
replacing it with an instance of a Backbone <literal>Attachments</literal> collection and
placing that as an object property:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">taskBeforeParsing.get('attachments')
// =&gt; [ { id: 1, upload_url: '...' }, { id: 2, upload_url: '...' } ]
taskBeforeParsing.attachments
// =&gt; undefined

/* parse attributes... */

taskAfterParsing.get('attachments')
// =&gt; undefined
taskAfterParsing.attachments
// =&gt; ExampleApp.Collection.Attachments(...)</programlisting>
<simpara>One way to do this is to override the <literal>parse</literal> function on the <literal>Task</literal> model.</simpara>
<simpara>There are two <literal>parse</literal> functions in Backbone: one on <literal>Collection</literal> and another on
<literal>Model</literal>.  Backbone will invoke them whenever a model or collection is populated
with data from the server; that is, during <literal>Model#fetch</literal>, <literal>Model#save</literal> (which
updates model attributes based on the server&#8217;s response to the HTTP PUT/POST
request), and <literal>Collection#fetch</literal>.  It&#8217;s also invoked when a new Model is
initialized and <literal>options.parse</literal> is set to <literal>true</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s important to note that <literal>parse</literal> is not called by <literal>Collection#reset</literal>,
which should be called with an array of models as its first argument.  Backbone
does support calling <literal>Collection#reset</literal> with just an array of bare attribute
hashes, but these will not be routed through <literal>Model#parse</literal>, the source of some
confusion.</simpara>
<simpara>Another way to intercept nested attributes and produce a full object graph
is to bind to the <literal>change</literal> event for the association attribute - in this case,
<literal>task.attachments</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Models.Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.on("change:attachments", this.parseAttachments);
    this.parseAttachments();
  },

  parseAttachments: function() {
    this.attachments = new ExampleApp.Collections.Attachments(this.get('attachments'));
    delete this.attachments;
  },

  // ...</programlisting>
<simpara>This ensures that our custom parsing gets invoked any time the <literal>attachments</literal>
attribute is changed, and when new model instances are created.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_when_to_fetch_deferred_data">
<title>When to fetch deferred data</title>
<simpara>Since a Backbone Task doesn&#8217;t always have its associations filled, when you
move from TasksIndex to TasksShow, you need to invoke task.fetch() to pull all
the task attributes from <literal>GET /tasks/:id</literal> and populate the <literal>attachments</literal>
association.  Whose concern is that?</simpara>
<simpara>You could lazily populate this association by making the <literal>task.attachments</literal>
association a function instead of a property. Compare <literal>task.attachments.each</literal> to
<literal>task.attachments().each</literal>; in the latter, the accessing function encapsulates the
concern of lazily fetching and populating, but then you run into the issue that
fetch is asynchronous.  Passing a callback into <literal>attachments()</literal> is kludgy; it
exposes the deferred nature of the association everywhere you need to access it.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll instead prefer to treat the deferred nature explicitly in the
<literal>Routers.Tasks#show</literal> route, a natural application seam to the <literal>TaskShow</literal> view.
This frees <literal>TaskShow</literal> from having to know about the persistence details of
the model.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks = Support.SwappingRouter.extend({
  // ...

  show: function(taskId) {
    var task = this.collection.get(taskId);
    var tasksRouter = this;
    task.fetch({
      success: function() {
        var view = new ExampleApp.Views.TaskShow({ model: task });
        tasksRouter.swap(view);
      }
    });
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, we have successfully deferred the <literal>Task#attachments</literal> association and
kept the concern clear of the view.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_complex_nested_models">
<title>Complex nested models</title>
<simpara>As your domain model grows more complex you might find that you want to deliver
information about more than one model together in a request - nested
attributes.  ActiveRecord provides <literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal>, a facility
for conveniently passing nested attributes through from requests to
ActiveRecord and sorting out the relationships there.</simpara>
<simpara>With more interactive web applications, one relevant change is that pages often
have several independently usable sections which update more frequently and
fluidly compared to their synchronous full-page submitting counterparts.  To
support this more finely-grained interface, the client-side implementation and
the HTTP JSON API are often more finely grained to match, resulting in fewer
bulk submissions with composite data structures.</simpara>
<simpara>A useful way to slice these situations is by whether they are comprised of
singular (one-to-one) relationships or plural relationships.  It&#8217;s worth
discussing an alternative to <literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal> that works for
singular associations.  Then, we&#8217;ll dive into how to model bulk updates for
plural associations from Backbone.</simpara>
<section id="_composite_models">
<title>Composite models</title>
<simpara>Consider a signup form that allows a customer to quickly get started with a
project management application.</simpara>
<simpara>They fill out information for their individual user account, as well as
information about the team they represent (and will eventually invite others
users from) and perhaps some information about an initial project.  One way to
model this is to present a <literal>signup</literal> resource that handles creating the correct
User, Team, and Project records.  The implementation would involve a vanilla
<literal>SignupsController</literal> and a Ruby class <literal>Signup</literal> class that delegates its nested
attributes to their respective models.</simpara>
<simpara>This composite class encodes the responsibility for translating between the
flat data structure produced by the user interface and the cluster of objects
that is produced.  It&#8217;s best suited for representing a handful of related
records that each have singular relationships - <literal>has_one</literal>/<literal>belongs_to</literal>, rather
than plural <literal>has_many</literal> relationships.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few other benefits to these composite classes, too.  They are handy
for adding any conditional logic in the composition, such as a Signup creating
a Billing entry for paid Plan levels.  The composite class should be easier to
isolation test, compared to testing the persistence outcomes of
<literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal>.  It&#8217;s also useful to note that the composite
Signup class is not actually persisted; it simply represents a convenient
abstraction in the domain model.</simpara>
<simpara>In this case, it&#8217;s straightforward to provide an HTTP API endpoint that exposes
the <literal>signups</literal> resource and to model this on the client side as a corresponding
Backbone model.  All of the attributes on the composite resource are at a single
level (not nested), so this is a familiar client-side implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>This general pattern encapsulates the composite nature of the resource, leaving
the fact that it is persisted across multiple tables as an implementation
detail.  This keeps the presentation tier simpler, unconcerned with the
composite nature of the resource.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_literal_accepts_nested_attributes_for_literal">
<title><literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal></title>
<simpara>A classic situation to encounter nested attributes is in <literal>has_many :through</literal>
relationships.  For example, consider a workflow in which you assign multiple
people to perform a job.  The three domain models are <literal>Job</literal>, <literal>Worker</literal>, and
the join model <literal>Assignment</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Job &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :assignments
  has_many :workers, :though =&gt; :assignments
end

class Assignment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :job
  belongs_to :worker
end

class Worker &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :assignments
  has_many :jobs, :through =&gt; :assignments
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Earlier, we discussed how Ajax-enabled web applications often provide more
finely-grained user interfaces that allow the user to submit information in
smaller chunks and allow the developer to model the persistence and HTTP API in
finer pieces.  Let&#8217;s say that we have a user interface where we create a job
and bulk assign several workers to the new job all in one form.  It&#8217;s possible
to achieve a good, fast user experience while still creating the job and its
child assignment records in separate requests.</simpara>
<simpara>However, it may still be preferable in some cases to perform these bulk
submissions, creating a parent record along with several child records all in
one HTTP request.  We&#8217;ll model this on the backend with Rails'
<literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Job &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :assignments
  has_many :workers, :though =&gt; :assignments
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :assignments
end</programlisting>
<simpara>As a quick refresher, this allows us in our Rails code to set
<literal>@job.assignments_attributes = [{}, {}, ...]</literal> with an Array of Hashes, each
containing attributes for a new <literal>Assignment</literal>, the join model.  This behavior of
Rails <literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal> shapes our HTTP API: A simple API
endpoint controller should be able to pass the request parameters straight
through to ActiveRecord, so the JSON going over the HTTP request will look
like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">/* POST /api/v1/jobs */
{
  name: "Move cardboard boxes to new warehouse",
  description: "Move boxes from closet C3 to warehouse W2",
  assignmment_attributes: [
    { worker_id: 1 },
    { worker_id: 3 },
    { worker_id: 5 }
  ]
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Shifting our focus to the client-side implementation, we can mostly ignore the
<literal>Assignment</literal> join model in Backbone, and can just model this nested association
directly.  We&#8217;ll use a <literal>Job</literal> Backbone model containing an <literal>Workers</literal> collection.
This is a simplified perspective of the relationship, a direct nesting or
embedding of <literal>Worker`s inside the `Job</literal>.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">MyApp = {};
MyApp.Models = {};
MyApp.Collections = {};

MyApp.Models.Worker = Backbone.Model.extend({
});

MyApp.Collections.Workers = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: ExampleApp.Models.Worker
});

MyApp.Models.Job = Backbone.Model.extend({
  urlRoot: '/api/v1/jobs',

  initialize: function() {
    this.workers = new MyApp.Collections.Workers();
  },

  toJSON: function() {
    var json = _.clone(this.attributes);

    json.assignment_attributes = this.workers.map(function(worker) {
      return { worker_id: worker.id };
    });

    return json;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, you can add workers directly to the job:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var worker3 = new MyApp.Models.Worker({ id: 3 });
var worker5 = new MyApp.Models.Worker({ id: 5 });

var job = new MyApp.Models.Job();
job.set({ title: "Raise barn walls" });
job.workers.add(worker3);
job.workers.add(worker5);

JSON.stringify(job.toJSON()) // Results in:
                             //
                             // {
                             //   "title":  "Raise barn walls",
                             //   "assignment_attributes": [
                             //     {"worker_id":3},
                             //     {"worker_id":5}
                             //   ]
                             // }</programlisting>
<simpara>and saving the Backbone <literal>Job</literal> model will submit correctly structured
JSON to the Rails server.</simpara>
<simpara>This is, of course, only covers the creation of nested bulk models.
Subsequently fetching a nested object graph from the server involves a handful
of separate design decisions around producing JSON on the server and parsing it
on the client. These concerns are discussed in the "Model relationships"
chapter.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_example_for_literal_accepts_nested_attributes_for_literal">
<title>Example for <literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal></title>
<simpara>In the example application, a task may be assigned to zero or more users.  The
association is tracked through an <literal>Assignment</literal> join model, and you can create
assignments at the same time as creating a task.  Users can see tasks they have
created or tasks which others have created and assigned to them.</simpara>
<simpara>We use <literal>accepts_nested_attributes_for</literal> for persisting the task and its nested
assignments.  The <literal>Task</literal> Backbone model also takes care of parsing the
assignment JSON to nest an <literal>Assignments</literal> collection inside itself.  It also
provides correctly-formatted JSON so that Rails picks up the nested
association.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>TasksNew</literal> view handles the expanding interface for adding more assignees,
and is also responsible for finding the Backbone <literal>User</literal> models by email
to associate them to the task while it is constructed.</simpara>

</section>
<section id="_duplicating_business_logic_across_the_client_and_server">
<title>Duplicating business logic across the client and server</title>
<simpara>When you&#8217;re building a multi-tier application where business logic is spread
across tiers, one big challenge you face is to avoid duplicating that logic
across tiers.  There is a trade-off here, between duplication and performance.
It&#8217;s desirable to have one and only one implementation of a particular concern
in your domain, but it&#8217;s also desirable for your application to perform
responsively.</simpara>
<section id="_an_example_model_validations">
<title>An example: model validations</title>
<simpara>For example, let&#8217;s say that a user must have an email address.</simpara>
<simpara>At one end of the scale, there is no duplication: all business logic is defined
in one tier, and other tiers access the logic by remote invocation.  Your Rails
<literal>Member</literal> model provides a validation:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Member &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validate :email, :presence =&gt; true
end</programlisting>
<simpara>The Backbone view attempts to persist the Member as usual, binding to its
<literal>error</literal> event to handle the server side error:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var MemberFormView = Backbone.View.extend({
  events: {
    "submit form": "submit"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "error");
    this.model.bind("error", this.error);
  },

  render: function() {
    // render form...
  },

  submit: function() {
    var attributes = new FormSerializer(this.$('form')).attributes();
    this.model.save(attributes);
  },

  error: function(model, errorResponse) {
    var errors = new ErrorList(errorResponse);
    new ErrorView({ el: self.el, errors: errors }).render();
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>This uses the <literal>ErrorView</literal> class which is able to parse the error hash returned
from Rails, which was discussed on the Validations section of the Models and
Collections chapter.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>This is also the first time you probably see <literal>_.bindAll()</literal>, so let&#8217;s diverge
briefly to introduce what it is doing.</simpara>
<simpara>When an event is triggered, the code invoking the callback is able to set the
javascript context. By calling <literal>_.bindAll(this, "error")</literal>, we are instead
overriding whatever context it may have been, and setting it to <literal>this</literal>. This is
necessary so that when we call <literal>this.$('form\')</literal> in the <literal>error()</literal> callback,
we get the right object back.</simpara>
<simpara>Always use <literal>_.bindAll</literal> when you need to force the javascript context (<literal>this</literal>)
within a function&#8217;s body.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>In the case of no duplication, your Backbone <literal>Member</literal> model does not declare
this validation.  An user fills out a form for a creating a new Member in your
application, submits the form, and, if they forgot to include an email address,
a validation message is displayed.  The application delegates the entire
validation concern to the server, as we saw in the Validations section of the
Models and Collections chapter.</simpara>
<simpara>However, round-tripping validation to the server can be too slow in some cases,
and we&#8217;d like to provide feedback to the end-user more quickly.  To do this, we
have to implement the validation concern on the client side as well.  Backbone
provides a facility for validating models during their persistence, so we could
write:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Member = Backbone.Model.extend({
  validate: function() {
    var errors = {};
    if (_.isEmpty(this.get('email'))) {
      errors.email = ["can't be blank"];
    }
    return errors;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Conveniently, we&#8217;ve structured the return value of the <literal>validate()</literal> function to
mirror the structure of the Rails error JSON we saw returned above.  Now, we
could augment the <literal>ErrorView</literal> class&#8217;s constructor function to handle either
client-side or server-side errors:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var ErrorList = function(responseOrErrors) {
  if (responseOrErrors &amp;&amp; responseOrErrors.responseText) {
    this.attributesWithErrors = JSON.parse(response.responseText);
  } else {
    this.attributesWithErrors = responseOrErrors;
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, with Backbone, the <literal>validate()</literal> function is called for each invocation of
<literal>set()</literal>, so as soon as we set the email address on the Member, its presence is
validated.  For the user experience with the quickest response, we could observe
changes on the email form field, updating the model&#8217;s <literal>email</literal> attribute whenever
it changes, and displaying the inline error message immediately.</simpara>
<simpara>With ErrorList able to handle either client-side or server-side error messages,
we have a server-side guarantee of data correctness, <footnote><simpara>At least, we
have a guarantee at the application level - database integrity and the
possibility of skew between Rails models and DB content is another discussion
entirely.</simpara></footnote> and a responsive UI that can validate the Member email presence
without round-tripping to the server.</simpara>
<simpara>The tradeoff we&#8217;ve made is that of duplication; the concern of "what constituted
a valid Member" is written twice&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in two different languages, no less.  In
some cases this is unavoidable.  In others, there are mitigation strategies for
reducing the duplication, or at least its impact on your code quality and
maintainability.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take a look at what kinds of logic you might find duplicated, and then
strategies for reducing duplication.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_kinds_of_logic_you_duplicate">
<title>Kinds of logic you duplicate</title>
<simpara>In Rails applications, our model layer can contain a variety of kinds of
business logic:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Validations - This is pretty straightforward, since there&#8217;s a well-defined
  Rails API for validating ActiveModel classes.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Querying - Sorting and filtering fall into this category.  Implementations
  vary slightly, but are often built with <literal>named_scope</literal> or class methods
  returning <literal>ActiveRecord::Relation</literal> instances.  Occasionally querying is
  delegated to class other than the ActiveRecord instance.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Callbacks - Similar to validations, there&#8217;s a well-defined API for callbacks
  (or "lifecycle events") on Rails models; <literal>after_create</literal> and such.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Algorithms - Everything else.  Sometimes they&#8217;re implemented on the
  ActiveRecord instances, but are often split out into other classes and used via
  composition.  One example from commerce apps would be an <literal>Order</literal> summing the
  costs of its <literal>LineItems</literal>.  Or consider an example from an agile project planning
  application, where a <literal>ProjectPlan</literal> recalculates a <literal>Project</literal>'s set of <literal>UserStory</literal>
  objects into weekly <literal>Iteration</literal> bucket objects.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>There are often other methods on your Rails models, but they either are a mix of
the above categories (a <literal>state_machine</literal> implementation could be considered a mix
of validations and callback) and other methods that don&#8217;t count as business
logic&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;methods that are actually implementing presentation concerns are a
frequent example.</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s worth considering each of these categories in turn, and how they can be
distributed across client and server to provide a responsive experience.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_validations_2">
<title>Validations</title>
<simpara>Validations are probably the lowest-hanging fruit.  Since the API for
declaring validations is largely declarative and well-bounded, we can imagine
providing an interface that introspects Rails models and builds a client-side
implementation automatically.</simpara>
<simpara>Certainly there are cases which aren&#8217;t possible to automate, such as custom
Ruby validation code or validations which depend on a very large dataset that
would be impractical to deliver to the client (say, a zipcode database).
These cases would need to fall back to either an XHR call to the server-side
implementation, or a custom-written client-side implementation - a duplicate
implementation.</simpara>
<simpara>This is actually what the
<ulink url="https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations">client_side_validations gem</ulink>
does, only it is not for Backbone yet. However, it is on the roadmap, and
the "model" branch  is a work in progress of this functionality. We will be
keeping an eye on this branch
<ulink url="https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations/tree/model">https://github.com/bcardarella/client_side_validations/tree/model</ulink></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_querying">
<title>Querying</title>
<simpara>Like validations, Rails the syntax and outcome of many common Rails query
methods are relatively declarative. It may be possible to convert server-side
scopes into client-side collection filtering. However, that is of questionable
value in most Backbone application to which we&#8217;ve had exposure.</simpara>
<simpara>In most Backbone apps there ends up being little duplication between client
and server sorting and filtering. Either the logic happens on the client and
is therefore not needed on the server, or the search logic happens on the
server and is not needed on the client.</simpara>
<simpara>If you find that your application has duplication here, consider whether there
may be a better way to separate responsibilities.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_callbacks">
<title>Callbacks</title>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve found that model callbacks are rarely duplicated between the client and
server side. It&#8217;s actually more likely that your client-side models will
differ sufficiently from the server-side models since they are in the
presentation tier and the concerns are different.</simpara>
<simpara>As you continue to push more logic client-side, as we&#8217;ve found is the
common trend when using Backbone, you may find that some life-cycle events
may move or be duplicated from the server to the client. The implementation and
concern of these often varies significantly from what they were on the server.
For example, a callback translated to Backbone will likely be implemented
as an event being fired and listened to by another object.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_algorithms">
<title>Algorithms</title>
<simpara>General algorithms are often the trickiest things to resolve duplication
between client and server for. It&#8217;s also common that important algorithms are,
in fact, needed on both client and server.</simpara>
<simpara>The more complicated the algorithm, the more troubling this will become. Bugs
may be introduced, and the client and server side algorithms might not
actually produce the same results.</simpara>
<simpara>It may be possible to implement the actual logic of the algorithm in
javascript and then make that available to Ruby by using something like ExecJS
<ulink url="https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs">https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs</ulink> to run the Javascript code from Ruby.</simpara>
<simpara>But you must weigh the cost of that additional complexity and overhead against
the code of duplicating logic.</simpara>
<simpara>Also, you could consider Javascript on the server side in something like
Node.js, exposed via a webservice that the Rails can access. However, it is
debatable that that is actually easier.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, it may be possible to reduce duplication by splitting responsibility
for the algorithm in pieces: half on the client and half on the server, and
then use coordinated communication and caching to accomplish the algorithm
and improve the performance, respectively.</simpara>

<section id="_synchronizing_between_clients">
<title>Synchronizing between clients</title>
<simpara>A big driving force behind the move to rich client web apps is to improve the
user experience. These applications are more responsive and can support more
detailed and stateful interactions.</simpara>
<simpara>One such interaction involves multiple concurrent users interacting with the
same resource in realtime. We can deliver a more seamless experience by
propagating users' changes to one another as they take place: when you and I
edit the same document, I see your changes on my screen as you type them. If
you&#8217;ve ever used Google Docs or Google Wave, you&#8217;ve seen this in action.</simpara>
<simpara>So, how can we build this functionality into our own applications?</simpara>
<section id="_the_moving_parts">
<title>The moving parts</title>
<simpara>There are a few different pieces that we&#8217;ll put together for this.  The basic parts are:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Change events. The fundamental unit of information that we broadcast through
   our system to keep clients in sync.  Delivered as messages, these events
   contain enough information for any receiving client to update its own data
   without needing a full re-fetch from the server.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
An event source.  With trusted clients, changes can originate directly from
   the client.  More often, however, we will want the server to arbitrate
   changes so that it can apply authorization, data filtering, and validations.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A transport layer that supports pushing to clients.
   <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">The WebSocket API</ulink> is such a transport, and
   is ideal for its low overhead and latency.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Event-driven clients.  Clients should be able to react to incoming change
   events, ideally handling them with incremental UI updates rather than
   re-drawing themselves entirely.  Backbone helps out in this department, as your
   client-side application app is likely already set up to handle such events.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
A message bus.  Separating the concern of message delivery from our main
   application helps it stay smaller and helps us scale our messaging and
   application infrastructure separately. There are already several great
   off-the-shelf tools we can use for this.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</section>
<section id="_putting_it_together_a_look_at_the_life_cycle_of_a_change">
<title>Putting it together: a look at the life cycle of a change</title>
<simpara>Revisiting our todo application, we&#8217;d like to add the ability to collaborate on
todo lists.  Different users will be able to work on the same todo list
concurrently.  Several users can look at the same list; adding, changing, and
checking off items.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few technical decisions mentioned previously.  For this example, we will:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Use Rails on the server and Backbone on the client.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Use the server as the canonical event source so that clients do not have to
   trust one another.  In particular, we&#8217;ll employ an <literal>ActiveRecord::Observer</literal>
   that observes Rails model changes and dispatches a change event.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Use <ulink url="http://faye.jcoglan.com">Faye</ulink> as the messaging backend, which has Ruby
   and JavaScript implementations for clients and server.  Faye implements the
   <ulink url="http://svn.cometd.com/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html">Bayeux protocol</ulink>, prefers
   WebSocket for transport (though it gracefully degrades to long polling, CORS,
   or JSON-P), and supports a bunch of other goodies like clustering and
   extensions (inbound- and outbound- message filtering, like Rack middleware).
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>In our application, there are several connected clients viewing the same todo
list, and one user Alice makes a change to an item on the list.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s take a look at the lifecycle of one change event.</simpara>
<simpara>Setup:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
An instance of JavaScript class <literal>BackboneSync.FayeSubscriber</literal> is
   instantiated on each client.  It is configured with a channel to listen to,
   and a collection to update.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The Faye server is started.
</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>

</orderedlist>
<simpara>On Alice&#8217;s machine, the client responsible for the change:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Alice clicks "Save" in her view of the list.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The "save" view event is triggered.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The event handler invokes <literal>this.model.save(attributes)</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>Backbone.Model.prototype.save</literal> calls <literal>Backbone.sync</literal>.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>Backbone.sync</literal> invokes <literal>$.ajax</literal> and issues an HTTP PUT request to the server.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>On the server:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
Rails handles the PUT request and calls <literal>#update_attributes</literal> on an ActiveRecord model instance.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
An <literal>ActiveRecord::Observer</literal> observing this model gets its <literal>#after_save</literal> method invoked.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The observer dispatches a change event message to Faye.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Faye broadcasts the change event to all subscribers.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
<simpara>On all clients:</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>FayeSubscriber</literal> receives the change event message, likely over a WebSocket.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>

<simpara>Now all the clients have received the changeset that Alice made.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_implementation_step_1_faye_server">
<title>Implementation: Step 1, Faye server</title>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll need to run Faye to relay messages from publishers to subscribers.  For
Rails apps that depend on Faye, I like to keep a <literal>faye/</literal> subdirectory under the
app root that contains a <literal>Gemfile</literal> and <literal>config.ru</literal>, and maybe a shell script to
start Faye:</simpara>
<programlisting language="bash" linenumbering="unnumbered">$ cat faye/Gemfile

</section>
<section id="_implementing_it_step_2_activerecord_observers">
<title>Implementing it: Step 2, ActiveRecord observers</title>
<simpara>Now that the message bus is running, let&#8217;s walk through the server code.  The
Rails app&#8217;s responsibility is this: whenever a Todo model is created, updated,
or deleted, publish a change event message.</simpara>
<simpara>This is implemented with an ActiveRecord::Observer.  We provide the
functionality in a module:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">module BackboneSync
  module Rails
    module Faye
      mattr_accessor :root_address
      self.root_address = 'http://localhost:9292'

      module Observer
        def after_update(model)
          Event.new(model, :update).publish
        end

        def after_create(model)
          Event.new(model, :create).publish
        end

        def after_destroy(model)
          Event.new(model, :destroy).publish
        end
      end

      class Event
        def initialize(model, event)
          @model = model
          @event = event
        end

        def broadcast
          Net::HTTP.post_form(uri, :message =&gt; message)
        end

        private

        def uri
          URI.parse("#{BackboneSync::Rails::Faye.root_address}/faye")
        end

        def message
          { :channel =&gt; channel,
            :data =&gt; data          }.to_json
        end

        def channel
          "/sync/#{@model.class.table_name}"
        end

        def data
          { @event =&gt; { @model.id =&gt; @model.as_json } }
        end
      end
    end
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>and then mix it into a concrete Observer class in our application.  In this
case, we name it <literal>TodoObserver</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TodoObserver &lt; ActiveRecord::Observer
  include BackboneSync::Rails::Faye::Observer
end</programlisting>
<simpara>This observer is triggered each time a Rails <literal>Todo</literal> model is created, updated,
or destroyed.  When one of these events happen, the Observer sends along a
message to our message bus, indicating the change.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say that a <literal>Todo</literal> was just created:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">&gt;&gt; Todo.create(title: "Buy some tasty kale juice")
=&gt; #&lt;Todo id: 17, title: "Buy some tasty kale juice", created_at: "2011-09-06 20:49:03", updated_at: "2011-09-07 15:01:09"&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The message looks like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "channel": "/sync/todos",
  "data": {
    "create": {
      "17": {
        "id": 17,
        "title": "Buy some tasty kale juice",

        "updated_at": "2011-09-07T15:01:09Z"
      }
    }
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Received by Faye, the message is broadcast to all clients subscribing to the
<literal>/sync/todos</literal> channel, including our browser-side <literal>FayeSubscriber</literal> objects.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_implementing_it_step_3_in_browser_subscribers">
<title>Implementing it: Step 3, In-browser subscribers</title>
<simpara>In each browser, we want to connect to the Faye server, subscribe to events on
channels that interest us, and update Backbone collections based on those
messages.</simpara>
<simpara>Faye runs an HTTP server, and serves up its own client library, so that&#8217;s easy to pull in:</simpara>
<programlisting language="xml" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://localhost:9292/faye.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>To subscribe to Faye channels, instantiate a <literal>Faye.Client</literal> and call <literal>subscribe</literal> on it:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var client = new Faye.Client('http://localhost:9292/faye');
client.subscribe('/some/channel', function(message) {
  // handle message
});</programlisting>
<simpara>When the browser receives messages from Faye, we want to update a Backbone
collection.  Let&#8217;s wrap up those two concerns into a <literal>FayeSubscriber</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">this.BackboneSync = this.BackboneSync || {};

BackboneSync.RailsFayeSubscriber = (function() {
  function RailsFayeSubscriber(collection, options) {
    this.collection = collection;
    this.client = new Faye.Client('&lt;%= BackboneSync::Rails::Faye.root_address %&gt;/faye');
    this.channel = options.channel;
    this.subscribe();
  }

  RailsFayeSubscriber.prototype.subscribe = function() {
    return this.client.subscribe("/sync/" + this.channel, _.bind(this.receive, this));
  };

  RailsFayeSubscriber.prototype.receive = function(message) {
    var self = this;
    return $.each(message, function(event, eventArguments) {
      return self[event](eventArguments);
    });
  };

  RailsFayeSubscriber.prototype.update = function(params) {
    var self = this;
    return $.each(params, function(id, attributes) {
      var model = self.collection.get(id);
      return model.set(attributes);
    });
  };

  RailsFayeSubscriber.prototype.create = function(params) {
    var self = this;
    return $.each(params, function(id, attributes) {
      var model = new self.collection.model(attributes);
      return self.collection.add(model);
    });
  };

  RailsFayeSubscriber.prototype.destroy = function(params) {
    var self = this;
    return $.each(params, function(id, attributes) {
      var model = self.collection.get(id);
      return self.collection.remove(model);
    });
  };

  return RailsFayeSubscriber;
})();</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, for each collection that we&#8217;d like to keep in sync, we instantiate a
corresponding <literal>FayeSubscriber</literal>.  Say, in your application bootstrap code:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">MyApp.Routers.TodosRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  initialize: function(options) {
    this.todos = new Todos.Collections.TodosCollection();
    new BackboneSync.FayeSubscriber(this.todos, { channel: 'todos' });
    this.todos.reset(options.todos);
  },

  // ...
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Now run the app, and watch browsers receive push updates!</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_testing_synchronization">
<title>Testing synchronization</title>
<simpara>Of course, this introduces a great deal of complexity into your app. There&#8217;s a
new daemon running on the server (faye), and every client now has to correctly
listen on its messages and rerender the appropriate views to show the new data.
This gets even more complex when the resource being updated is currently being
edited by another user. Your own requirements will ditcate the correct behavior
in cases like that, but what&#8217;s most important is that you are able to reproduce
such workflows in automated tests.</simpara>
<simpara>While there is a chapter dedicated to testing Backbone applications, this section
describes the tools and approach that will allow you to verify this behavior in
tests.</simpara>
<simpara>Following an outside-in development approach, we start with an acceptance test
and dive into the isolated testing examples when the acceptance tests drive us
to them. There&#8217;s nothing novel in regards to isolation testing of these
components, so we will not touch on them here. Instead, we&#8217;ll describe how to
write an acceptance test for the above scenario.</simpara>
<simpara>The required pieces for the approach are:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Ensure a faye server running on your testing environment.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Fire up a browser session using an browser acceptance testing framework.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Sign in as Alice.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Start a second browser session and sign in as Olivia.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Edit some data on Alice&#8217;s session.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
See the edited data reflected on Olivia&#8217;s session.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>We will be using cucumber with Capybara and RSpec for this example.</simpara>
<simpara>To ensure the Faye server is running, we merely try to make a connection
to it when cucumber boots, failing early if we can&#8217;t connect. Here&#8217;s a
small snippet that you can drop in <literal>features/support/faye.rb</literal> to do
just that:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">begin
  Timeout.timeout(1) do
    uri = URI.parse(BackboneSync::Rails::Faye.root_address)
    TCPSocket.new(uri.host, uri.port).close
  end
rescue Errno::ECONNREFUSED, Errno::EHOSTUNREACH, Timeout::Error
  raise "Could not connect to Faye"
end</programlisting>
<simpara>With that in place, we are now sure that Faye is running and we can move
on to our cucumber scenario. Create a <literal>features/sync_task.feature</literal> file
and let&#8217;s describe the desired functionality:</simpara>
<programlisting language="cucumber" linenumbering="unnumbered">  @javascript
  Scenario: Viewing a task edited by another user
    Given the following users exist:
      | email               |
      | alice@example.com   |
      | olivia@example.com  |
    Given the following task exists:
      | title                  |
      | Purchase Cheeseburgers |
    And I am using session "Alice"
    And I sign in as "alice@example.com"
    Then I should see "Purchase Cheeseburgers"
    When I switch to session "Olivia"
    And I sign in as "olivia@example.com"
    And I edit the "Purchase Cheeseburgers" task and rename it to "Purchase Giant Cheeseburgers"
    And I switch to session "Alice"
    Then I should see "Purchase Giant Cheeseburgers"</programlisting>
<simpara>Thankfully, Capybara allows us to run acceptance tests with client side
behavior by specifying different drivers to run scenarios that require
javascript vs. those which don&#8217;t. The very first line above, <literal>@javascript</literal>,
tells capybara to use a javascript enabled driver such as selenium or
capybara-webkit.</simpara>
<simpara>The following two steps that create some fixture data are provided by
<ulink url="https://github.com/thougthbot/factory_girl">FactoryGirl</ulink>, which looks
into your factory definitions and builds step definitions based on their
attributes and associations.</simpara>
<simpara>But then we get into the meat of the problem: switching sessions. Capybara
introduced the ability to name and switch sessions in your scenarios via
the <literal>session_name</literal> method. The definition for the <literal>I am using session
"Alice"</literal> step looks like so:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">When /^I (?:am using|switch to) session "([^"]+)"$/ do |new_session_name|
  Capybara.session_name = new_session_name
end</programlisting>
<simpara>This allows us to essentially open up different browsers, in the case you&#8217;re
using the selenium driver, and it is the key to exercising background syncing
code in capybara acceptance testing.</simpara>
<simpara>With this in place, the rest is quite straightforward&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;we simply interact
with the application as you would with any cucumber scenario, visiting pages,
filling in forms, and verifying results on the page, all the while specifying
which session you&#8217;re interacting with.</simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, the <literal>BackboneSync.FayeSubscriber</literal> JavaScript class should also
be tested in isolation. We&#8217;ve used jasmine for testing JavaScript behavior
succesfully, so it is the approach we recommend. For more information about
using jasmine, refer to the chapter on testing.</simpara>

<section id="_uploading_attachments">
<title>Uploading attachments</title>
<simpara>While Ruby gems such as paperclip make the API for attaching files to models
very similar to the standard ActiveModel attribute persistence API, attaching
files to Backbone models is not quite as straightforward.  In this section,
we&#8217;ll take a look at the general approach for attaching files, and then examine
the specific implementation used in the example application.</simpara>
<section id="_saving_files_along_with_attributes">
<title>Saving files along with attributes</title>
<simpara>When you save a Backbone model, its attributes are sent to the server via
Backbone.sync.  It would be ideal to treat file uploads in the same fashion,
storing the files as attributes on the client-side Backbone model and uploading
them, along with all the other attributes, when then model is saved.</simpara>
<simpara><literal>Backbone.Model#save</literal> delegates to <literal>Backbone.sync</literal> which, by default, transmits
data using <literal>$.ajax</literal> with a <literal>dataType</literal> of <literal>json</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>We <emphasis>could</emphasis> send files along here, too, using the HTML5 File API to read the
file data and send it serialized inside the JSON payload.  This would require
us to make server-side changes to parse the file from JSON, and there is no IE
support for the File API as of IE9.  (<ulink url="http://caniuse.com/fileapi">http://caniuse.com/fileapi</ulink>)</simpara>
<simpara>A slightly more sophisticated approach could use the FormData API and
XMLHttpRequest Level 2 to serialize attributes instead, transmitting them to
the server as multipart/form-data, which already has a defined serialization
for files.  This would allow you to work without modifying your server, but
still leaves IE completely unsupported.</simpara>
<simpara>To support the broadest set of browsers, but still deliver file uploads in the
same request as attributes, you use a hidden iframe technique.  Probably the
most transparent approach is to take advantage of jQuery&#8217;s
<ulink url="http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Transports">AJAX Transport</ulink>
functionality with the
<ulink url="http://cmlenz.github.com/jquery-iframe-transport/">jquery.iframe-transport.js</ulink>
plugin.  There is a caveat with this approach too, however, as we cannot get at
the response headers, breaking automatic content type detection and, more
importantly, breaking the use of HTTP response codes to indicate server-side
errors.  This approach would deliver the smoothest user experience, at the cost
of more integration code.</simpara>
<simpara>The <ulink url="https://github.com/leppert/remotipart">Remotipart gem</ulink> provides some such
conventions for delivering response information back to the client-side,
although the use-case is slightly different and the library uses the
<literal>jquery.form.js</literal> <literal>ajaxSubmit()</literal> function to perform an iframe upload, instead
of the smaller <literal>jquery.iframe-transport.js</literal> plugin.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_separating_file_upload_and_model_persistence">
<title>Separating file upload and model persistence</title>
<simpara>The general approach we&#8217;ll take is to separate the file upload request from the
model persistence requests.  The server will respond to the upload with an
identifier, which we can use on the client side to populate an attribute on a
Backbone model, whether it is a new model or an existing one.</simpara>
<simpara>This does mean that you can have unclaimed attachments if the end user leaves
the page before saving the parent model, and these should be periodically swept
if disk usage is an issue.</simpara>
<simpara>When modeling this from the Rails side, you can choose to persist the file
upload identifier (e.g. the local path or S3 URL) on one of your models
directly, or you can break the attachment out into its own ActiveRecord model
and store a foreign key relation on your primary model.  For our example
we&#8217;ll do the latter, adding an <literal>Attachment</literal> model and resource to the app.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll use the HTML5 File API because it&#8217;s a straightforward approach to illustrate.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_example_step_1_upload_interface">
<title>Example, Step 1: Upload Interface</title>
<simpara>In our example task management app, we&#8217;d like for the owner of a task to attach
several images to each task.  We want uploads to happen in the task detail view,
and for the uploads to appear in-page as soon as they are uploaded.  We don&#8217;t
need to display uploads on the index view.</simpara>
<simpara>First, let&#8217;s write an acceptance test to drive the functionality:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">@javascript
Feature: Attach a file to a task

  As a user
  I want to attach files to a task
  So that I can include reference materials

  Background:
    Given I am signed up as "email@example.com"
    When I sign in as "email@example.com"
    And I go to the tasks page
    And I create a task "Buy"
    And I create a task "Eat"

  Scenario: Attach a file to a task
    When I attach "spec/fixtures/blueberries.jpg" to the "Buy" task
    Then I should see "blueberries.jpg" attached to the "Buy" task
    And I should see no attachments on the "Eat" task

  Scenario: Attach multiple files to a task
    When I attach "spec/fixtures/blueberries.jpg" to the "Buy" task
    And I attach "spec/fixtures/strawberries.jpg" to the "Buy" task
    Then I should see "blueberries.jpg" attached to the "Buy" task
    And I should see "strawberries.jpg" attached to the "Buy" task</programlisting>
<simpara>The first failures we get are from the lack of upload UI.  We&#8217;ll drop down to
unit tests to drive this out:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">//= require application

describe("ExampleApp.Views.TaskShow", function() {
  var task, view, $el;

  beforeEach(function() {
    task = new ExampleApp.Models.Task({
      id: 1,
      title: "Wake up"
    });

    view = new ExampleApp.Views.TaskShow({ model: task });
    $el = $(view.render().el);
  });

  it("renders the detail view for a task", function() {
    expect($el).toHaveText(/Wake up/);
  });

  it("renders a file upload area", function() {
    expect($el).toContain(".upload label:contains('Attach a file to upload')");
    expect($el).toContain(".upload button:contains('Upload attachment')");
    expect($el).toContain(".upload input[type=file]");
  });

  it("links the upload label and input", function() {
    var $label = $el.find('.upload label');
    var $input = $el.find('.upload input');
    expect($label.attr('for')).toEqual($input.attr('id'));
  });
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Then, we&#8217;ll add the upload form to the TaskShow view to the <literal>tasks/show.jst.ejs</literal>
template, so the UI elements are in place:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;p&gt;Task title&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="attachments"&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="upload"&gt;
  &lt;label for="input"&gt;Attach a file to upload&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="file" name="file" /&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Upload attachment&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="#"&gt;Back to task list&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Once our units pass, we run the acceptance tests again. The next failure we see
is that nothing happens upon upload.  We&#8217;ll drop down to Jasmine here to write
a spec for uploading that asserts the correct upload request is issued:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">it("uploads the file when the upload method is called", function() {
  view.upload();
  expect(this.requests.length).toEqual(1);
  expect(this.requests[0].requestBody.constructor).toEqual(FormData);
});

it("uploads an attachment for the current task", function() {
  view.upload();
  expect(this.requests[0].url).toEqual("/tasks/1/attachments.json");
});</programlisting>
<simpara>And implement using the <literal>uploader.js</literal> library:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">render: function () {
  // ...
  this.attachUploader();
  return this;
},

// ...

attachUploader: function() {
  var uploadUrl = "/tasks/" + this.model.get('id') + '/attachments.json';

  this.uploader = new uploader(this.uploadInput(), {
    url:      uploadUrl,
    success:  this.uploadSuccess,
    prefix:   'upload'
  });
},</programlisting>
<simpara>The acceptance tests still aren&#8217;t passing, and a little digging will reveal
that we need to manually set the CSRF token on the upload request.  Normally,
this would be set by <literal>jquery_ujs.js</literal> with a jQuery AJAX prefilter, but the
upload code we are using manually constructs an <literal>XMLHttpRequest</literal> instead of
using <literal>$.+ajax, so that it may bind to the +onprogress</literal> event.</simpara>
<simpara>We write a spec:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">it("sets the CSRF token for the upload request", function() {
  view.upload();
  var expectedCsrfToken = $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content');
  expect(this.requests[0].requestHeaders['X-CSRF-Token']).toEqual(expectedCsrfToken);
});</programlisting>
<simpara>And add the CSRF token implementation at the end of <literal>attachUploader</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">attachUploader: function() {
  // ...

  this.uploader.prefilter = function() {
    var token = $('meta[name="csrf-token"]').attr('content');
    if (token) this.xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', token);
  };
},</programlisting>
<simpara>And the spec is green.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_example_step_2_accept_and_persist_uploads_in_rails">
<title>Example, Step 2: Accept and Persist Uploads in Rails</title>
<simpara>At this point, we are sending the upload request from the client, but the
server isn&#8217;t responding, much less persisting the file.  This portion is
vanilla Rails and Paperclip.  We create an <literal>Attachment</literal> model, a nested
<literal>:attachments</literal> route under the <literal>tasks</literal> resource, and <literal>AttachmentsController</literal>.
Then, we add the <ulink url="http://rubygems.org/gems/paperclip">paperclip gem</ulink> to the Gemfile,
and include the <literal>has_attached_file</literal> directive in the <literal>Attachment</literal> model along
with the corresponding <literal>have_attached_file</literal> example to the <literal>Attachment</literal> model spec.</simpara>
<simpara>Now that attachments are uploaded to the server, the final step is to display
attachments to the user.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_example_step_3_display_uploaded_files">
<title>Example, Step 3: Display Uploaded Files</title>
<simpara>For structuring the attachments in Backbone, we want to be able to do something
like the following:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;% this.task.attachments.each(function(attachment) { %&gt;
  Attached: &lt;img src="&lt;%= attachment.get('upload_url')" /&gt; %&gt;
&lt;% }); %&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>So, the Task model will have attachments property that is instantiates with an
AttachmentsCollection instance.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;re providing a JSON represenatation rooted at the Task model using
<ulink url="https://github.com/nesquena/rabl">Rabl</ulink>, which we discussed previously in
"Implementing the API: presenting the JSON".</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">object @task

attributes :id, :created_at, :updated_id, :title, :complete, :user_id

child :attachments do
  attributes :id, :created_at, :updated_id, :upload_file_name, :upload_url
end</programlisting>
<simpara>We also tell Rabl to suppress the root JSON node, much
like we did with <literal>ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered"># config/initializers/rabl_init.rb
Rabl.configure do |config|
  config.include_json_root = false
end</programlisting>
<simpara>We can test drive the attachment display from Jasmine, see task_show_with_attachments_spec.js:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">//= require application

describe("ExampleApp.Views.TaskShow for a task with attachments", function() {
  var task, view, $el;

  beforeEach(function() {
    task = new ExampleApp.Models.Task({
      id: 1,
      title: "Buy pies",
      attachments: [
        {
          upload_file_name: "blueberries.jpg",
          upload_url: "http://www.realblueberries.com/images/Blueberry-Cluster-1.jpg"
        },
        {
          upload_file_name: "strawberries.jpg",
          upload_url: "http://strawberriesweb.com/three-strawberries.jpg"
        }
      ]
    });

    view = new ExampleApp.Views.TaskShow({ model: task });
    $el = $(view.render().el);
  });

  it("displays attachments", function() {
    expect($el).toContain(".attachments img[src='http://www.realblueberries.com/images/Blueberry-Cluster-1.jpg']")
    expect($el).toContain(".attachments img[src='http://strawberriesweb.com/three-strawberries.jpg']")

  it("displays attachment filenames", function() {
    expect($el.find(".attachments p").first()).toHaveText('Attached: blueberries.jpg');
    expect($el.find(".attachments p").last()).toHaveText('Attached: strawberries.jpg');
  });
});</programlisting>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll represent attachments as an associated collection on Task, so we&#8217;ll need
a Backbone model and collection for attachments, too.  First, the Task model
should parse its JSON to populate the associated attachments.  Test drive that
in the ExampleApp.Models.Tasks Jasmine spec:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">//= require application

describe("ExampleApp.Models.Tasks", function() {
  it("knows if it is complete", function() {
    var completeTask = new ExampleApp.Models.Task({ complete: true });

  it("knows if it is not complete", function() {
    var incompleteTask = new ExampleApp.Models.Task({ complete: false });
    expect(incompleteTask.isComplete()).toBe(false);
  });
});

describe("ExampleApp.Models.Tasks#initialize", function() {
  var attributes, task;

  beforeEach(function() {
    attributes = {"id":1,"title":"Sweet Task","attachments":[{"upload_url":"/uploads/1.jpg"},{"upload_url":"/uploads/2.jpg"}]};
    task = new ExampleApp.Models.Task(attributes);
  });

  it("creates collections for nested attachments", function() {
    expect(task.attachments instanceof ExampleApp.Collections.Attachments).toEqual(true);
    expect(task.attachments.size()).toEqual(2);
  });

  it("populates the collection with Attachment models", function() {
    expect(task.attachments.first() instanceof ExampleApp.Models.Attachment).toEqual(true);
    expect(task.attachments.first().get('upload_url')).toEqual('/uploads/1.jpg');

    expect(task.attachments.last() instanceof ExampleApp.Models.Attachment).toEqual(true);
    expect(task.attachments.last().get('upload_url')).toEqual('/uploads/2.jpg');
  });
});

describe("ExampleApp.Models.Task when the attachments attribute changes", function() {
  it("re-parses the collection", function() {
    var task = new ExampleApp.Models.Task({"attachments":[{"upload_url":"1.jpg"},{"upload_url":"2.jpg"}]});
    expect(task.attachments.size()).toEqual(2);

    task.set({"attachments":[{"upload_url":"1.jpg"}]});
    expect(task.attachments.size()).toEqual(1);
  });
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The first failures reference the Backbone Attachment model and Attachments
collection, so we add those, driving the collection out with a spec.</simpara>
<simpara>Next, we can implement the Task model&#8217;s JSON parsing to populate its associated
attachments:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Models.Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.bind("change:attachments", this.parseAttachments);
    this.parseAttachments();
  },

  parseAttachments: function() {
    this.attachments = new ExampleApp.Collections.Attachments(this.get('attachments'));
  },

  // ...

});</programlisting>
<simpara>At this point, we return back to the acceptance test, and it&#8217;s fully passing.</simpara>

<title>Testing</title>
<section id="_full_stack_integration_testing">
<title>Full-stack integration testing</title>
<simpara>Your application is built from a collection of loosely coupled modules,
spreading across several layers of the development stack.  To ensure the
application works correctly from the perspective of the end-user, full-stack
integration testing drives your application and verifies correct functionality
from the user interface level.  This is also referred to as acceptance testing.</simpara>
<section id="_introduction_2">
<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>Writing a full-stack integration test for a Javascript-driven web application
will always involve some kind of browser, and although writing an application
with Backbone can make a world of difference to you, the tools involved are all
the same as far as your browser is concerned. Because your browser can run
Backbone applications just like any Javascript application, you can write
integration tests for them just like you would for any Javascript application.
Also, because of tools like Capybara that support various drivers, you can
generally test a Javascript-based application just like you&#8217;d test a web
application where all the logic lives on the server. This means that having a
powerful, rich-client user interface won&#8217;t make your application any harder to
test. If you&#8217;re familiar with tools like Capybara, Cucumber, and RSpec, you can
dive right in and start testing your Backbone application. If not, the
following sections should give you a taste of the available tools for
full-stack integration tests written in Ruby.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_capybara">
<title>Capybara</title>
<simpara>Though there is a host of tools available to you for writing automated
integration tests, we recommend <ulink url="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">capybara</ulink>.
In a hybrid Rails application, where some portions are regular request/response
and other portions are JavaScript, it&#8217;s valuable to have a testing framework
that abstracts the difference as much as possible.</simpara>
<simpara>Capybara is a high-level library that allows you to write tests from a user&#8217;s
perspective.  Consider this example, which uses RSpec:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">describe "the login process", :type =&gt; :request do
  it "accepts an email and password" do
    User.create(:email =&gt; 'alice@example.com', :password =&gt; 'password')
    visit '/'
    fill_in 'Email', :with =&gt; 'alice@example.com'
    fill_in 'Password', :with =&gt; 'password'
    click_button 'Log in'
    page.should have_content('You are logged in as alice@example.com')
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice that, as you read the spec, you&#8217;re not concerned about whether the login
interface is rendered with JavaScript, or whether the authentication request is
over AJAX or not.  A high-level library like Capybara keeps you from having to
consider the back-end implementation, freeing you to focus on describing the
application&#8217;s behavior from an end-user&#8217;s perspective.  This perspective of
writing specs is often called behavior-driven development (BDD).</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_cucumber">
<title>Cucumber</title>
<simpara>You can take another step toward natural language tests, using Cucumber to
define mappings.  Cucumber is a test runner and a mapping layer.  The specs you
write in Cucumber are user stories, written in a constrained subset of English.
The individual steps in these stories are mapped to a testing library.  In our
case, and probably most cases, to Capybara.</simpara>
<simpara>This additional layer of abstraction can be helpful for a few reasons.</simpara>
<simpara>Some teams have nontechnical stakeholders writing integration specs as user
stories.  Cucumber sits at a level of abstraction that fits comfortably there:
high level enough for nontechnical stakeholders to write in, but precise enough
to be translated into automated tests.</simpara>
<simpara>On other teams, the person writing the story is the same person who implements
it.  Still, it is valuable to use a tool that reinforces the distinction between
the description phase and the implementation phase of the test.  In the
description phase, you are writing an English description of the software
interaction:</simpara>
<programlisting language="cucumber" linenumbering="unnumbered">Given there is a user account "alice@example.com" with the password "password"
When I go to the home page
And I fill in the login form with "alice@example.com" and "password"
And I click the login button
Then I should see "You are logged in as alice@example.com"</programlisting>
<simpara>In the implementation phase of the test, you define what these steps do.  In
this case, they are defined to run Capybara methods:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">Given /^there is a user account "(.*)" with the password "(.*)"$/ do |email, password|
  User.create(:email =&gt; email, :password =&gt; password)
end

When "I go to the home page" do
  visit "/"
end

When /^I fill in the login form with "(.*)" and "(.*)"$/ do |email, password|
  fill_in 'Email', :with =&gt; email
  fill_in 'Password', :with =&gt; password
end

When "I click the login button" do
  click_button "Login"
end

Then /^I should see "(.*)"$/ do |text|
  page.should have_content(text)
end</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_drivers">
<title>Drivers</title>
<simpara>Capybara supports multiple drivers through a common API, each with benefits and
drawbacks. We prefer to use either
<ulink url="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">capybara-webkit</ulink> or Selenium.</simpara>
<simpara>When possible, we use capybara-webkit. It&#8217;s a fast, headless fake browser
written using the WebKit browser engine. It&#8217;s generally faster than Selenium
and it&#8217;s dependent on your system settings once compiled. This means that
upgrading the browser you use every day won&#8217;t ever affect your tests.</simpara>
<simpara>However, capybara-webkit is still young, and sometimes there&#8217;s no substitute
for having a real browser to run your tests through. In these situations, we
fall back to using Selenium. Selenium will always support anything you can do
in your actual browser, and supports multiple browsers, including Firefox,
Chrome, Safari, and even Internet Explorer.</simpara>
<simpara>Capybara makes it easy to switch between drivers. Just set your default driver to capybara-webkit:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit</programlisting>
<simpara>And then tag a Cucumber scenario as @javascript. If you need to fall back to using Selenium, tag that scenario with @selenium.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_isolated_unit_testing">
<title>Isolated unit testing</title>
<simpara>Integration testing your application is great for ensuring that the product
functions as intended, and works to mitigate against risk of regressions.
There are additional benefits, though, to writing tests for individual units
of your application in isolation, such as focused failures and decoupled code.</simpara>
<simpara>When an integration test fails, it can be difficult to pin down the exact reason
why; particularly when a regression is introduced in a part of the application
seemingly far away from where you&#8217;re working.  With the finer granularity of a
unit test suite, failures are more targeted and help you get to the root of the
problem more quickly.</simpara>
<simpara>Another benefit comes from unit testing when you test-drive code; when you write
the tests before the implementation.  Since you are starting with a piece of
code which is client to your implementation modules, setup and dependency
concerns are brought to your attention at the beginning of implementation,
rather than much later during development when modules are integrated. Thinking
about these concerns earlier helps you design modules which are more loosely
coupled, have smaller interfaces, and are easier to set up.  If code is hard to
test, it will be hard to use.  Writing the test first, you have a clear and
concrete opportunity to make your implementation easier to use.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, there are some behaviors that are difficult or impossible to test
using a full-stack integration test. Here&#8217;s a common example: you want to
display a spinner graphic or disable a UI element while waiting for the server
to respond to a request. You can&#8217;t test this with an integration test because
the time the server takes to respond is variable; by the time your test checks
to look for the spinner graphic, the response will probably be finished. Even if
it passes once, it may fail on the next run, or on the run after that. And if
you decide to do an almost-full-stack test and fake out a slow response on the
server, this will slow down your tests and introduce unnecessary indirection
to an otherwise simple component. During isolation tests, it&#8217;s easy to use
techniques like dependency injection, stubbing, and mocking to test erratic
behaviors and side effects that are difficult to observe during integration
tests.</simpara>

<simpara>As there is plentiful content available for testing tools and strategies in
Rails, we&#8217;ll focus on isolation testing your Backbone code.</simpara>
<section id="_isolation_testing_in_javascript">
<title>Isolation testing in JavaScript</title>
<simpara>There are many JavaScript testing frameworks available.  Some run in-browser and
provide facility for setting up DOM fixtures.  Others are designed for
standalone JavaScript code and can run on browserless JavaScript runtimes.</simpara>
<simpara>We&#8217;ll use the Jasmine framework for writing our isolation specs.  It integrates
easily into a Rails application, and provides an RSpec-like syntax for writing
specs:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">describe("ExampleApp.Models.Tasks", function() {
  it("knows if it is complete", function() {
    var completeTask = new ExampleApp.Models.Task({ complete: true });
    expect(completeTask.isComplete()).toBe(true);
  });

  it("knows if it is not complete", function() {
    var incompleteTask = new ExampleApp.Models.Task({ complete: false });
    expect(incompleteTask.isComplete()).toBe(false);
  });
});</programlisting>
<simpara>To run the Jasmine tests in the example application, simply run <literal>bundle exec
rake jasmine</literal> and visit <ulink url="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</ulink>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_what_to_test">
<title>What to test?</title>
<simpara>We frequently found it difficult to test Javascript components in isolation
before we started using Backbone. Although jQuery really takes the pain out of
working with the DOM and communicating with the server, it&#8217;s not
object-oriented and provides nothing to help split up your application.
Because most of our HTML was in ERB-based templates, it was generally
difficult to test the Javascript that relied on that HTML without also loading
the web application. This meant that almost all of our early Javascript tests
were full-stack integration tests.</simpara>
<simpara>Using Backbone, it&#8217;s much easier to test components in isolation. View code is
restricted to views, and templates contain only HTML or interpolation code
that can be interpreted by the Javascript view layer, such as jst or mustache
templates. Models and collections can be given data in their constructor, and
simple dependency injection allows unit tests to fake out the remote server.
We don&#8217;t test routers in isolation as often because they&#8217;re very light on
logic, but those are also easy to test by calling action methods directly or
triggering events.</simpara>
<simpara>Since Backbone components are just as easy to test in isolation as they are to
test full-stack, we generally use the same guidelines as we do for all Rails
applications to decide what to test where.</simpara>
<simpara>Start with a top-down, full-stack Cucumber or RSpec scenario to describe the
feature you&#8217;re writing from a high level perspective, and begin implementing
behavior from the top as necessary. If you find that the feedback loop between
a test failure and the code to pass it starts to feel too long, start writing
isolated unit tests for the individual components you need to write to get
closer to passing a higher-level assertion. As an example, an assertion from
Capybara that fails because of a missing selector may need new models,
controllers, views, and routes both on the server and in Backbone. Rather than
writing several new componenets without seeing the failure message change,
write a unit test for each piece as you progress down. If it&#8217;s clear what
component you need to add from the integration test failure, add that
component without writing an isolated unit test. For example, a failure from a
missing route or view file reveals an obvious next step, but missing text on a
page because a model method doesn&#8217;t actually do anything may motivate a unit
test.</simpara>
<simpara>Many features will have edge cases or several logical branches. Anything that
can&#8217;t be described from a high-level, business value perspective should be
tested from an isolated unit test. For example, when testing a form, it makes
sense to write a scenario for the success path, where a user enters valid
data that gets accepted and rendered by the application, and one extra
scenario for the failure path, where a user enters invalid data that the
system can&#8217;t accept. However, when adding future validations or other reasons
that a user&#8217;s data can&#8217;t be accepted, it makes sense to just write an extra
isolated unit test, rather than adding a new scenario that largely duplicates
the original failure scenario.</simpara>
<simpara>When writing isolation tests, the developer needs to decide exactly how much
isolation to enforce. For example, when writing a unit test for a model,
you&#8217;ll likely decide not to involve an actual web server to provide data.
However, when testing a view that composes other subviews, you&#8217;ll likely allow
the actual subview code to run. There are many cases when it will make
sense to just write a unit test that involves a few components working
together, rather than writing a full-stack scenario.</simpara>
<simpara>The overall goals when deciding how much to test via integration vs isolation
are to keep high-level business logic described in top-down tests, to keep
details and edge cases described in unit tests, and to write tests that
exercise the fewest number of components possible while remaining robust and
descriptive without becoming brittle.</simpara>

<simpara>In this example, we&#8217;ll be using Cucumber, Capybara, RSpec, and Jasmine to
test-drive a todo list.</simpara>
<simpara>The Selenium driver comes configured with Capybara and is the quickest driver to
get running. By default it runs your tests in a remote controlled Firefox
session, so you&#8217;ll want to install Firefox if you don&#8217;t have it already.</simpara>
<note><simpara>If you&#8217;d like to test on a WebKit-based browser, you can set up the
<ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver">Selenium ChromeDriver</ulink> to
run integration tests against Chrome.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The other dependencies you can install by adding them to your Gemfile. The gems
you&#8217;ll need for testing are jasmine (currently tracking the edge version from
git), cucumber-rails, rspec-rails, and capybara.  You&#8217;ll want to add RSpec,
Cucumber, and Jasmine to both the test and development groups so that you can
run generators. With all our testing dependencies in place, the Gemfile in our
sample application looks like this:</simpara>

  Scenario: View tasks
    Given the following tasks exist:
      | Title                                | user                     |

      | Master backbone                      | email: email@example.com |
    And I am on the home page
    Then I should see "Master backbone" within the tasks list
    And I should see "Purchase the backbone on rails ebook" within the tasks list</programlisting>
<simpara>Running this, we see a failure:</simpara>

  features/view_tasks.feature:13:in `Then I should see "Master backbone" within the tasks list'</programlisting>
<simpara>A common gotcha when testing Rails apps with our structure is seeing false
positives in bootstrapped data. Consider that, if we had just written the step
<literal>Then I should see "Master backbone"</literal> instead of scoping it with <literal>within the
tasks list</literal>, then some test drivers would count the JSON that is used to
bootstrap Backbone collections as visible text on the page, and the test would
pass without us actually rendering the text to the page.</simpara>
<simpara>Since this we are doing outside-in development and testing for user interface,
we will need outline the UI first.  To do this, first we&#8217;ll need a page to host
our code.  Let&#8217;s create and route a Rails <literal>TasksController</literal>. We&#8217;ll bootstrap the

<simpara>To render our tasks, we&#8217;ll want a TasksIndex Backbone view class.  But before we
write this class, we&#8217;ll motivate it with a Jasmine isolation spec:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">describe("ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex", function() {
  it("renders a task table", function() {
    var view = new ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex();
    view.render();

    expect(view.$el).toBe("#tasks");
    expect(view.$el).toContain("table");
  });
});</programlisting>
<simpara>We use the <ulink url="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery">jasmine-jquery</ulink> library to
provide DOM matchers for Jasmine like <literal>toContain()</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>To run the Jasmine spec, run <literal>bundle exec rake jasmine</literal> and visit <ulink url="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>To make this test pass, we&#8217;ll add a small template and make the <literal>TasksIndex</literal>
view render it:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: 'div',
  id: 'tasks',

  initialize: function() {
  },

  render: function () {
    this.$el.html(JST['tasks/index']({}));
    return this;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>app/assets/templates/tasks/index.jst.ejs</literal> template:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>Now our Jasmine specs pass:</simpara>

<simpara>Since the Jasmine specs pass, we&#8217;ll pop back up a level and run the Cucumber
story.  Running it again, the failure is slightly different.  The <literal>"#tasks
table"</literal> element is present on the page, but doesn&#8217;t contain the content we want.</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">@javascript

<simpara>Drop back down to Jasmine and write a spec motivating the TasksIndex view to
accept a collection and render it.  We&#8217;ll rewrite our existing spec, since we
are changing the TasksIndex interface to require that a collection be passed in:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">//= require application

  it("renders a collection of tasks", function() {
    var tasksCollection = new ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks();
    tasksCollection.reset([

      { title: "Brush your teeth" }
    ]);

    var view = new ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex({collection: tasksCollection});
    var $el = $(view.render().el);

    expect($el).toHaveText(/Wake up/);

<simpara>write a test to motivate the collection:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">describe("ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks", function() {

  it("is persisted at /tasks", function() {
    var collection = new ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks();

<simpara>and pass the test by implementing the collection:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: ExampleApp.Models.Task,
  url: '/tasks'
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Running the Jasmine specs again, we&#8217;re making progress.  The TasksIndex view is
accepting a collection of tasks, and now we have to render it:</simpara>
<programlisting language="text" linenumbering="unnumbered">Expected '&lt;div id="tasks"&gt;&lt;table&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Completed&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt;' to have text 'Wake up'.</programlisting>
<simpara>The simplest thing we can do to get the spec passing is to pass the <literal>tasks</literal>

<simpara>This is because the Jasmine spec is an isolation spec, and verifies that the

<title>Encoding data when bootstrapping JSON data</title>
<simpara>As it turns out, bootstrapping JSON data in your erb templates can introduce a
security vulnerability. Consider the case when a user enters a malicious
<literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal> as the title of a task. When the tasks#index page is reloaded, and
we naively bootstrap task data on the page, the browser will interpret and
execute the script. Since it&#8217;s possible for this script to run on another
user&#8217;s session, it can be quite damaging if it goes on to, for exmple, edit or
destroy the user&#8217;s data.</simpara>
<simpara>To protect against this, we make use of the fact that on HTML5 documents,
script tags that do not have a type of <literal>text/javascript</literal> won&#8217;t be automatically
evaluated by the browser. Therefore we can create an element with the
HTML-encoded bootstraped data enclosed in a script of type <literal>text/json</literal>, fetch
it using a simple jquery selector, and parse it ourselves.</simpara>
<simpara>Here&#8217;s an example:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;script type="text/json" id="bootstrap"&gt;
  { "tasks": &lt;%= @tasks.to_json %&gt; }

<simpara>A reliable way to unencode the HTML-encoded JSON string is to use the browser&#8217;s
native functionality, by settings an element&#8217;s <literal>innerHTML</literal>.  So in the above
script, we create a <literal>json_div</literal> var, assign its <literal>innerHTML</literal> to the bootstrap
script&#8217;s text, and retrieve the innerText back out, unencoded. The final result
is the <literal>data</literal> variable containing proper JSON with no HTML escaping that can be
parsed and passed along to your app&#8217;s <literal>initialize</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>This approach can be seen on the example app on the
<literal>app/views/tasks/index.html.erb</literal> template.</simpara>
<simpara>Now, the application&#8217;s models, populated by the bootstrap data structure,
contains raw data that is not HTML-escaped.  When you render this data into the
DOM, make sure you escape the HTML at that point in time:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">// From app/assets/javascripts/views/task_item.js:

this.$('label').html(this.model.escape('title')); // not model.get</programlisting>
