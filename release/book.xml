<simpara>Backbone.js and Underscore.js are the non-minified versions. This is for
informational purposes, but also because the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline will
compress and minify them.</simpara>
<simpara>While Rails 3.1 defaults to Coffee script, we have decided to make all example
code normal Javascript as we believe that will be the most understandable to
the current readers.</simpara>

<section id="_backbone_js_and_mvc">
<title>Backbone.js and MVC</title>
<simpara>Model–View–Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern used in many
applications to isolate "domain logic" (the application logic for the user)
from the user interface (input and presentation).</simpara>
<figure><title>Model-view-controller concept</title>

  <imageobject>
  <imagedata fileref="image/MVCDiagram.png"/>
  </imageobject>
  <textobject><phrase>image/MVCDiagram.png</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>In the above diagram, a solid line represents a direct association, a dashed
line an indirect association (for example, via an observer).</simpara>
<simpara>As a user of Rails, you&#8217;re likely already familiar with the concept of MVC and
the benefits that the separation of concerns can give you. However, Rails
itself is not doing "traditional" MVC. A traditional MVC is event-based. This
means that the views trigger events which the controller figures out what to do
with. It can be argued that the requests generated by the browser are the
"events" in Rails, however, due to the single-threaded, request-response nature
of the web, the control flow between the different levels of MVC is much more
straight-forward.</simpara>
<simpara>Given that Javascript has events, and that much of the interactions between the
different components of Backbone.js in the browser are not limited to
request/response, programming with Backbone.js is in a lot of ways more like
working with a traditional MVC architecture.</simpara>
<simpara>That being said, technically speaking, Backbone.js is <emphasis>not</emphasis> MVC, and this was
acknowledged by the creators of Backbone.js when they renamed Controllers to
Routers in version 0.5.0.</simpara>
<simpara>So what is Backbone.js then if not MVC? Technically speaking, it&#8217;s just the
Models and the Views with a Router to handle flow between them. In Backbone.js
the views will handle many of the aspects that controllers would typically
handle, such as actually figuring out what to do next and what to render.</simpara>
<simpara>While you could do it, the benefit of actually introducing a Controller in your
application would be limited, and the more pragmatic approach is to realize the
great organization that Backbone.js gives you is much better than what you had
before. The fact that it doesn&#8217;t have a nice name, or strict adherence to a
pattern, isn&#8217;t worth worrying about.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_what_goes_where">
<title>What Goes Where</title>
<simpara>Part of the initial learning curve of Backbone.js can be figuring out what goes
where, and mapping it to your expectations set by working with Rails. In Rails
we have Models, Views, Controllers, and Routers. In Backbone.js, we have
Models, Views, Templates, and Routers.</simpara>
<simpara>The models in Backbone.js and Rails are analogous. Because it lacks
controllers, Backbone.js routers and views work together to pick up the
functionality provided by Rails controllers. Finally, in Rails, when we say
views, we actually mean templates. In Backbone.js, however, you have a
separation between the view and templates.</simpara>
<simpara>Once you introduce Backbone.js into your stack, you grow the layers in your
stack by four levels. This can be daunting at first, and frankly, at times it
can be difficult to keep everything going on in your application straight.
Ultimately, the additional organization and functionality of Backbone.js
outweighs the costs, so let&#8217;s break it down.</simpara>

<simpara>In a typical Rails and Backbone.js application, the initial interaction between
the layers will be as follows:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>

<simpara>
A request from a user comes in the <emphasis role="strong">Rails router</emphasis> identifies what should

The <emphasis role="strong">Rails view template</emphasis> will include <emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js initialization</emphasis>, usually
  this is populating some <emphasis role="strong">Backbone models</emphasis> with JSON data provided by the
 <emphasis role="strong">Rails view</emphasis>
</simpara>
</listitem>

<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js router</emphasis> method calls that method, some initial processing

<listitem>
<simpara>
The <emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js view</emphasis> reads <emphasis role="strong">templates</emphasis> and uses <emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js</emphasis> models to

</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>At this point, the user will see a nice page in their browser and be able to
interact with it. The user interacting with elements on the page will trigger
actions to be taken at any level of the above sequence: <emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js model</emphasis>,
<emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js views</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js router</emphasis>, or requests to the remote server.</simpara>
<simpara>Requests to the remote server may be any one of the following:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
At the <emphasis role="strong">Backbone.js model</emphasis> level, communicating with Rails via JSON.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Normal requests that don&#8217;t hit Backbone.js and trigger a full page reload.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Which of the above remote server interactions you use will depend upon the
desired result, and the type of user interface. This book should help you
understand which interaction you&#8217;ll want to choose for each portion of your
application.</simpara>

<title>Organizing your Backbone.js code in a Rails app</title>
<simpara>When using Backbone.js in a Rails app, you&#8217;ll have two kinds of
Backbone.js-related assets: classes, and templates.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_rails_3_0_and_prior">
<title>Rails 3.0 and prior</title>
<simpara>With Rails 3.0 and prior, store your Backbone.js classes in
<literal>public/javascripts</literal>:</simpara>
<screen>public/
  javascripts/
    jquery.js
    jquery-ui.js
    collections/
      users.js
      todos.js
    models/
      user.js
      todo.js
    routers/
      users_router.js
      todos_router.js
    views/
      users/
        users_index.js
        users_new.js
        users_edit.js
      todos/
        todos_index.js</screen>
<simpara>If you are using templates, we prefer storing them in <literal>app/templates</literal> to keep
them separated from the server views:</simpara>
<screen>app/
  views/
    pages/
      home.html.erb
      terms.html.erb
      privacy.html.erb
      about.html.erb
  templates/
    users/
      index.jst
      new.jst
      edit.jst
    todos/
      index.jst
      show.jst</screen>
<simpara>On Rails 3.0 and prior apps, we use Jammit for packaging assets and
precompiling templates:</simpara>
<simpara><ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/">http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/</ulink><?asciidoc-br?>
<ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/#jst">http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/#jst</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>Jammit will make your templates available in a top-level JST object. For
example, to access the above todos/index.jst template, you would refer to it
as:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['todos/index']</programlisting>
<simpara>Variables can be passed to the templates by passing a Hash to the template, as
shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['todos/index']({ model: this.model })</programlisting>
<section id="_a_note_on_jammit_and_a_jst_naming_gotcha">
<title>A note on Jammit and a JST naming gotcha</title>
<simpara>One issue with Jammit that we&#8217;ve encountered and worked around is that the JST
template path can change when adding new templates.</simpara>
<simpara>When using Jammit, there is a slightly sticky issue as an app grows from one
template subdirectory to multiple template subdirectories.</simpara>
<simpara>Let&#8217;s say you place templates in app/templates. You work for a while on the
"Tasks" feature, placing templates under app/templates/tasks. So, window.JST
looks something like:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['form']
JST['show']
JST['index']</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, you add another directory under app/templates, say app/templates/user.
Now, all JST references are prefixed with their parent directory name so they
are unambiguous:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">JST['tasks/form']
JST['tasks/show']
JST['tasks/index']
JST['users/new']
JST['users/show']
JST['users/index']</programlisting>
<simpara>This breaks existing JST references. You can work around this issue by applying
the following monkeypatch to Jammit, in config/initializers/jammit.rb</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">Jammit::Compressor.class_eval do
  private
  def find_base_path(path)
    File.expand_path(Rails.root.join('app','templates'))
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>As applications are moving to Rails 3.1, they&#8217;re also moving to Sprockets for
the asset packager.  Until then, many apps are using Jammit for asset
packaging.  One issue with Jammit we&#8217;ve encountered and worked around is that
the JST template path can change when adding new templates.  We have an open
issue and workaround:</simpara>

<title>Rails 3.1</title>
<simpara>Rails 3.1 introduces the asset pipeline:</simpara>
<simpara><ulink url="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>which uses the Sprockets library for preprocessing and packaging assets:</simpara>
<simpara><ulink url="http://getsprockets.org/">http://getsprockets.org/</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>To take advantage of the built-in asset pipeline, organize your Backbone.js
templates and classes in paths available to the asset pipeline.  Classes go in
<literal>app/assets/javascripts/</literal>, and templates go alongside, in
<literal>app/assets/templates/</literal>:</simpara>

<simpara>In Rails 3.1, jQuery is provided by the jquery-rails gem, and no longer
needs to be included in your directory structure.</simpara>
<simpara>Using Sprockets' preprocessors, we can use templates as before.  Here, we&#8217;re
using the EJS template preprocessor to provide the same functionality as
Underscore.js' templates.  It compiles the <literal>*.jst</literal> files and makes them
available on the client side via the <literal>window.JST</literal> object. Identifying the
<literal>.ejs</literal> extension and invoking EJS to compile the templates is managed by
Sprockets, and requires the <literal>ejs</literal> gem to be included in the application
Gemfile.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Underscore.js templates:

</note>
<simpara>To make the <literal>*.jst</literal> files available and create the <literal>window.JST</literal> object, require
them in your application.js Sprockets manifest:</simpara>
<screen>//  other application requires
//= require_tree ../templates
//= require_tree .</screen>
<simpara>Additionally, load order for Backbone.js and your Backbone.js app is very
important. jQuery and Underscore.js must be loaded before Backbone.js, then
the Rails authenticity token patch must be applied. Then your models must be
loaded before your collections (because your collections will reference your
models) and then your routers and views must be loaded.</simpara>
<simpara>Fortunately, sprockets can handle this load order for us. When all is said and
done your application.js Sprockets manifest will be as shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">//= require jquery

<section id="_converting_your_rails_models_to_backbone_js_friendly_json">
<title>Converting your Rails models to Backbone.js-friendly JSON</title>
<simpara>By default Backbone.js communicates with your Rails application via JSON gets
and posts. If you&#8217;ve ever made a JSON api for your Rails app, then for the most
part this will be very similar.</simpara>
<simpara>If you haven&#8217;t ever made a JSON api for your Rails application before, lucky
you, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward.</simpara>
<section id="_setting_up_models">
<title>Setting Up Models</title>
<simpara>One important aspect to keep in mind as you plan out how your Backbone.js
interface will behave, and how it will use your Rails back-end is that there is
no need to have a one-to-one mapping between your Rails models and your
Backbone.js models.</simpara>
<simpara>The smaller an application is, the more likely that there will be a one-to-one
mapping between both Backbone.js and Rails models and controllers.</simpara>
<simpara>However, if you have a sufficiently complex application, its more likely that
you <emphasis>won&#8217;t</emphasis> have a one-to-one mapping due to the differences in the tools
Backbone.js gives you and the fact that you&#8217;re building a user-interface, not a
back-end. Some of the reasons why you won&#8217;t have a one to one mapping include:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Because you&#8217;re building a user interface, not a back-end, it&#8217;s likely that
some of your backbone models will aggregate information from multiple Rails
models into one Backbone.js model.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
This Backbone.js model may or may not be named the same as one of your Rails
models.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Backbone.js gives you a new type of object not present in Rails:
Collections.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Backbone.js doesn&#8217;t have the concept of relationships out of the box.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>With that said, lets take the simple case first and look at how you might make a
Backbone.js version of a Rails model.</simpara>
<simpara>In our example application, we have a Task model. The simplest Backbone.js
representation of this model would be as shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  urlRoot: '/tasks'
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The urlRoot property above indicates to Backbone.js that the server url for
instances of this model will be found at /tasks/:id.</simpara>
<simpara>In Rails, its possible to access individual Tasks, as well as all Tasks (and
query all tasks) through the same Task model. However, in Backbone.js models
only represent the singular representation of a Task. Backbone.js splits out the
plural representation of Tasks into what it calls Collections.</simpara>
<simpara>The simplex Backbone.js collection to represent our Tasks would be the
following.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task
});</programlisting>
<simpara>If we specify the url for Tasks in our collection instead, then models within
the collection will use the collection&#8217;s url to construct their own urls, and
the urlRoot no longer needs to be specified in the model. If we make that
change, then our collection and models will be as follows.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks'
});

var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({});</programlisting>
<simpara>Notice in the above model definitions that there is no specification of the
attributes on the model. Like ActiveRecord, Backbone.js models get their
attributes from the schema and data given to them. In the case of Backbonejs,
this schema and data are the JSON from the server.</simpara>
<simpara>The default JSON representation of an ActiveRecord model is a Hash that includes
all the model&#8217;s attributes. It does not include the data for any related models
or any methods on the model, but it does include the ids of any related models
as those are stories in a relation name _id attribute on the model.</simpara>
<simpara>The JSON representation of your ActiveRecord models will be retrieved by calling
to_json on them. You customize the output of to_json by overriding the as_json
method in your model.</simpara>
<simpara>The most common things you&#8217;ll do in your Rails app when working with Backbone.js
are the following.</simpara>
<simpara>Its likely that you&#8217;ll wan to switch from including all attributes by default to
excluding some attributes. This can be done by specifying explicitly only the
attributes that are to be included, or specifying the attributes that should be
included. Which one you choose will depend on how many attributes your model has
and how paranoid you are about something important appearing in the JSON when it
shouldn&#8217;t be there. If your concerned about sensitive data unintentionally being
included in the json when it shouldn&#8217;t be then you&#8217;ll want to switch to
everything being explicitly included in the json. Otherwise, its a matter of
preference and you can do what feels best for you an your app.</simpara>
<simpara>To explicitly specify the attributes to be included in the json, use the :only
option, as shown in the following as_json implementation.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:only =&gt; [ :id, :title ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>The above as_json override will make it so that the json will <emphasis>only</emphasis> include the
id and title attributes, even if there are many other attributes on the model.</simpara>
<simpara>If instead you want to include all attributes by default and just exclude a few,
you accomplish this with the :except option, as shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:except =&gt; [ :encrypted_password ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Another common customization you will want to do in the json is include the
output of methods on your model. This is accomplished with the :methods option,
as shown in the following example.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:methods =&gt; [ :calculated_value ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>The final thing you&#8217;ll most commonly do with your JSON is include related
objects. If our Tasks have_many Comments, to include all of the JSON for
comments on a Task in the JSON for a Task. You do this with the :include option,
as shown in the following example.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">def as_json(options = {})
  super(options.merge(:include =&gt; [ :comments ]))
end</programlisting>
<simpara>As you probably suspect, you can then customize the JSON for the comments by
overriding the as_json method on the Comment model.</simpara>
<simpara>In Rails 3.1 ActiveRecord::Base.include_root_in_json is set to false. This is
in contrast to Rails 3.0 which had it set to true. This reversal was made to
simplify the JSON returned by default in Rails application, but it is fairly big
change from the default behavior of Rails 3.0.</simpara>
<simpara>Practically speaking, this change is a good one, but if you&#8217;re upgrading an
existing Rails 3.0 application to Rails 3.1 and you already have a published
api or Backbone.js code, you probably want to set it back to true, as it will
cause your public api to change, breaking a lot of code, including your
Backbone.js application.</simpara>
<simpara>While these are the most common as_json options you&#8217;ll use when working with
Backbone.js, it certainly isn&#8217;t all of them. The official, complete,
documentation for the as_json method can be found here:
<ulink url="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON/as_json">http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveModel/Serializers/JSON/as_json</ulink></simpara>
</section>
<section id="_setting_up_controllers">
<title>Setting Up Controllers</title>
<simpara>The Backbone models and collections will talk to your Rails controllers. While
your models may not have a one-to-one mapping with their Rails counterparts, it
is likely that you&#8217;ll have at least one controller corresponding to every
Backbone.js model.</simpara>
<simpara>Fortunately for us, Backbone.js models will communicate in the normal RESTful
way that Rails controllers understand, using the proper verbs to support the
standard RESTful Rails controller actions: index, show, create, update, and
destroy. Backbone.js does not make any use the new action.</simpara>
<simpara>Therefore, it&#8217;s just up to us to write a <emphasis>normal</emphasis> restful controller.</simpara>
<simpara>There are a few different ways you can write your controllers for interacting
with you Backbone.js models and collections. However, the newest and cleanest
way is to use the respond_with method introduced in Rails 3.0.</simpara>
<simpara>When using respond_with, in your controller you specify what formats are
supported with the method respond_to. In your individual actions, you then
specify the resource or resources to be delivered using respond_with, as shown
in the example Tasks controller and index action below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  respond_to :html, :json

  def index
    respond_with(@tasks = Task.all)
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>In the above example Tasks controller, the respond_to line declares that this
controller should respond to both the HTML and JSON formats. Then, in the
index action, the respond_with call will perform the appropriate action for
the requested format.</simpara>
<simpara>The above controller is equivalent to the following one, using the older
respond_to method.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  def index
    @tasks = Task.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.json { render :json =&gt; @tasks }
    end
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Using respond_with you can create succinct controllers that respond with a
normal web page, but also expose a JSON api that Backbone.js will use.</simpara>
<section id="_validations">
<title>Validations</title>
<simpara>If a model has a validate method defined, it will be validated before it&#8217;s
attributes are set. If validation fails, no changes to the model will occur,
and the "error" event will be fired. Your validate method will be passed the
attributes that are about to be updated. You can signal that validation passed
by returning nothing from your validate method. You can signify that
validation has failed by returning something from the method. What you return
can be as simple as a string, or a more complex object that describes the
error in all its gory detail.</simpara>
<simpara>In practice, much of the validation logic for your models will continue to be
handled on the server, as fully implementing validations on the client side
would often require duplicating a lot of server-side business logic.</simpara>
<simpara>Instead, your Backbone.js applications will likely rely on server-side
validation logic. How to handle a failure scenario is passed in to Backbone.js
model save call as a callback, as shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">task.save({title: "New Task title"}, {
  error: function(){
    // handle error from server
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The error callback will be triggered if your server returns a non-200
response. Therefore, you&#8217;ll want your controller to return a non-200 HTTP
response code if validations fail.</simpara>
<simpara>A controller that does this would be as shown in the following example.</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class TasksController &lt; ApplicationController::Base
  respond_to :json

  def create
    @task = Task.new(params[:task])
    if @task.save
      respond_with(@task)
    else
      respond_with(@task, :status =&gt; :unprocessable_entity)
    end
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Your error callback will receive both the model as it was attempted to be
saved and the response from the server. You can take that response and handle
the errors returned by the above controller in whatever way is fit for your
application. For more information about handling and displaying errors, see
the Form helpers section of the Views and Templates chapter.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_setting_up_views">
<title>Setting Up Views</title>
<simpara>Most Backbone.js applications will be a "single-page app". This means that
your Rails application will render a single-page which properly sets up
Backbone.js and the data it will use. From there, ongoing interaction with
your Rails application occurs via the JSON apis.</simpara>
<simpara>The most common page for this single-page application will be the index action
of a controller, as in our example application and the tasks controller.</simpara>
<simpara>You will want to create a Hash variable in Javascript for your Backbone,js
application to reside. This variable will serve as a namespace for your
Backbone,js application. Namespacing all of the javascript is desirable to to
avoid potential collisions in naming. For example, its possible that a
Javascript library you want to use might also create a Task variable. If you
didn&#8217;t namespace your Task model then this would conflict and be unusable.</simpara>
<simpara>This variable includes a place to hold Models, Collections, Views, and Routes,
and an init method which will be called to initialize the application. Its
very common to create a new Router in the init function, and
Backbone.history.start() must be called in order to route the initial URL.
This app variable will look like the following.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var ExampleApp = {
  Models: {},
  Collections: {},
  Views: {},
  Routers: {},
  init: function() {
    new ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks();
    Backbone.history.start();
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>You can find this file in the example app in
app/assets/javascripts/example_app.js.</simpara>
<important><simpara>You must instantiate a Backbone.js router before calling
Backbone.history.start() otherwise Backbone.history will be undefined.</simpara></important>
<simpara>Then, inside app/views/tasks/index.html.erb you will call the initialize
method. This will appear as follows.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;%= content_for :javascript do -%&gt;
  &lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
    ExampleApp.init();
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>For performance reasons, you will almost always "prime the pump" and give
Backbone.js its initial data within the HTML view for this page. In our
example, the tasks have already been provided to the view in a @tasks instance
variable, and that can be used to prime the pump, as shown below.</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;%= content_for :javascript do -%&gt;
  &lt;%= javascript_tag do %&gt;
    ExampleApp.init(&lt;%= @tasks.to_json %&gt;);
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end -%&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>The above example uses Erb to pass the JSON for the tasks to the init method.</simpara>
<simpara>Once you make this change, the ExampleApp.init method then becomes:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var ExampleApp = {
  Models: {},
  Collections: {},
  Views: {},
  Routers: {},
  init: function(tasks) {
    new ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks();
    this.tasks = new ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks(tasks);
    Backbone.history.start();
  }
};</programlisting>
<simpara>Finally, you must have a Router in place which knows what to do. We&#8217;ll cover
routers in more detail in the Views and Templates chapter. For a more in-depth
presentation on writing and using routes please go there. However, routers are
an important part of the infrastructure you need to start using Backbone.js
and we can&#8217;t make our example here work without them.</simpara>
<simpara>Backbone.js routers provide methods for routing application flow based on
client-side URL fragments (#fragment).</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>Backbone.js now includes support for pushState, which can use real, full URLs
instead of url fragments for routing.</simpara>
<simpara>However, pushState support in Backbone.js is fully opt-in due to lack of
browser support and that additional server-side work is required to support it.</simpara>
<simpara>pustState support is current limited to the latest versions of Firefox,
Chrome, and Safari and Mobile Safari. For a full listing of support and more
information about the History API, of which pushState is a part, visit
<ulink url="http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html#how">http://diveintohtml5.org/history.html#how</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>Thankfully, if you opt-in to pushState in Backbone.js, browsers that don&#8217;t
support pushState will continue to use hash-based URL fragments, and if a hash
URL is visited by a pushState-capable browser, it will be transparently
upgraded to the true URL.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition to browser support, another hurdle to seamless use of pushState is
that because the URL used are real URLs, your server must now how to render
each of the urls. For example, if your Backbone.js application as a route of
/tasks/1, your server-side application must be able to respond to that page if
the browser visits that URL directly.</simpara>
<simpara>For most applications, you can handle this by just rendering the content you
would have for the root URL and letting backbone handle the rest of the
routing to the proper location. But for full search-engine crawlability, your
server-side application will need to render the entire HTML of the requested page.</simpara>
</note>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index"
  },

  index: function() {
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>A basic router consists of a routes hash which is a mapping between url
fragments and methods on the router. If the current URL fragment, or one that
is being visited matches one of the routes in the hash, its method will be
called.</simpara>
<simpara>The example router above is all that is needed to complete our Backbone.js
infrastructure. When a user visits /tasks the index.html.erb view will be
rendered which properly initialized Backbone.js and its dependencies and the
Backbone.js models, collections, routers, and views.</simpara>

<simpara>When using Backbone.js in a Rails app, you will run into a conflict with the
Rails built in Cross Site Scripting (XSS) protection.</simpara>
<simpara>When Rails XSS is enabled, each POST or PUT request to Rails should include a
special token which is verified to ensure that the request originated from a
user which is actually using the Rails app. In recent versions of Rails,
Backbone.js Ajax requests are no exception.</simpara>
<simpara>To get around this, you have two options. Disable Rails XSS protection (not
recommended), or make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS.</simpara>
<simpara>To make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS you can monkeypatch Backbone.js
to include the Rails XSS token in any requests it makes.</simpara>
<simpara>The following is one such script.</simpara>

<simpara>Imagine you&#8217;re writing a todo app. Consider two views: an index view which
contains all the tasks, and a detail view that shows detail on one task. The
interface switches between the two views, and both views can modify existing
tasks (say, to indicate that the task is complete or incomplete.)</simpara>

</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>The view classes for these pages could be written as follows:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TasksIndex = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: JST['tasks/tasks_index'],
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'tasks',

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "render");
    TaskApp.tasks.bind("change", this.render);
    TaskApp.tasks.bind("add", this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    $(this.el).html(this.template({tasks: this.collection}));
  }
});</programlisting>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TaskDetail = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: JST['tasks/tasks_detail'],
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'task',

  events: {
    "click .comments .form-inputs button": "createComment"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "render");

    this.model.bind("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.bind("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.bind("add", this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    $(this.el).html(this.template({task: this.model}));
  },

  createComment: function() {
    var comment = new Comment({ text: this.$('.new-comment-input').val() });
    this.$('.new-comment-input').val('');
    this.model.comments.create(comment);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Each task on the index page links to the detail view for itself. When a user
follows one of these links and navigates from the index page to the detail
page, then interacts with the detail view to change a model, the <literal>change</literal> event
on the <literal>TaskApp.tasks</literal> collection is fired. One consequence of this is that
the index view, which is still bound and observing the <literal>change</literal> event, will
re-render itself.</simpara>
<simpara>This is both a functional bug and a memory leak: not only will the index view
re-render and disrupt the detail display momentarily, but navigating back and
forth between the views without disposing of the previous view will keep
creating more views and binding more events on the associated models or
collections.</simpara>
<simpara>These can be extremely tricky to track down on a production application,
especially if you are rendering children views, much like how Rails can render
a partial for each member of a collection. Sadly, there&#8217;s no "garbage
collection" for views in Backbone, so your application needs to manage this
itself.</simpara>
<simpara>The solution is to make sure you unbind events and remove views when you leave
them. Our approach to this is to use a convention in <literal>Router</literal> instances, and reuse
this as a <literal>Router</literal> subclass, <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_swapping_router">
<title>Swapping router</title>
<simpara>When switching from one view to another, we should clean up the previous view.
Let&#8217;s augment our view to include the ability to clean itself up by "leaving"
the DOM:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var MyView = Backbone.View.extend({
  // ...

  leave: function() {
    this.unbind();
    this.remove();
  },

  // ...
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>unbind()</literal> and <literal>remove()</literal> functions are provided by <literal>Backbone.Events</literal> and
<literal>Backbone.View</literal>.  <literal>unbind()</literal> will remove all callbacks registered on the view,
and <literal>remove()</literal> will remove the view&#8217;s element from the DOM.</simpara>
<simpara>In simple cases, we replace one full page view with another full page (less any
shared layout). We introduce a convention that all actions underneath one
<literal>Router</literal> share the same root element, and define it as <literal>el</literal> on the router.</simpara>
<simpara>Now, a <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> can take advantage of the <literal>leave()</literal> function, and clean
up any existing views before swapping to a new one.  It swaps into a new view by
rendering that view into its own <literal>el</literal>:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">SwappingRouter = function(options) {
  Backbone.Router.apply(this, [options]);
};

_.extend(SwappingRouter.prototype, Backbone.Router.prototype, {
  swap: function(newView) {
    if (this.currentView &amp;&amp; this.currentView.leave) {
      this.currentView.leave();
    }

    this.currentView = newView;
    this.currentView.render();
    $(this.el).empty().append(this.currentView.el);
  }
});

SwappingRouter.extend = Backbone.Router.extend;</programlisting>
<simpara>Now all you need to do in a route function is call <literal>swap()</literal>, passing in the
new view that should be rendered. The <literal>swap()</literal> function&#8217;s job is to call
<literal>leave()</literal> on the current view, render the new view and append it to the
router&#8217;s <literal>el</literal>, and finally store who the current view is, so that next time
<literal>swap()</literal> is invoked, it can be properly cleaned up as well.</simpara>
<section id="swapping-internals">
<title>SwappingRouter and Backbone internals</title>
<simpara>If the code for <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> seems a little confusing, don&#8217;t fret: it is,
thanks to JavaScript&#8217;s object model! Sadly, it&#8217;s not as simple to just drop in
the <literal>swap</literal> method into <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>, or call <literal>Backbone.Router.extend</literal> to
mixin the function we need.</simpara>
<simpara>Our goal here is essentially to create a subclass of <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>, and to
extend it without modifying the original class. This gives us a few benefits:
first, <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> should work with Backbone upgrades. Second, it shold be
<emphasis role="strong">obvious</emphasis>  and <emphasis role="strong">intention-revealing</emphasis> when a controller needs to swap views. If
we chose to just mix in a <literal>swap</literal> method, and called it from a direct descendant
of <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>, an unaware (and unlucky) programmer now needs to go on a
deep source dive in an attempt to figure out where that&#8217;s coming from. At least
with a subclass, the hunt should start at the file where it was defined.</simpara>
<simpara>The procedure used to create <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> is onerous thanks to a mix of
Backbone-isms and just how clunky inheritance is in JavaScript. First off, we
need to define the constructor, which delegates to the <literal>Backbone.Router</literal>
constructor with the use of <literal>Function#apply</literal>. The next block of code uses
Underscore&#8217;s <literal>Object#extend</literal> to create the set of functions and properties that
will become <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>. The <literal>extend</literal> function takes a destination, in
this case the empty prototype for <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>, and copies in the
properties in the <literal>Backbone.Router</literal> prototype along with our new custom object
that includes the <literal>swap</literal> function.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, the subclass cake is topped off with some Backbone frosting: setting
<literal>extend</literal>, which is a self-propagating function that all Backbone public classes
use. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at this function, as of Backbone 0.5.3:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var extend = function (protoProps, classProps) {
  var child = inherits(this, protoProps, classProps);
  child.extend = this.extend;
  return child;
};

// Helper function to correctly set up the prototype chain, for subclasses.
// Similar to `goog.inherits`, but uses a hash of prototype properties and
// class properties to be extended.
var inherits = function(parent, protoProps, staticProps) {
  // sparing our readers the internals of this function... for a deep dive
  // into the dark realms of JavaScript's prototype system, read the source!
}</programlisting>
<simpara>So, it&#8217;s a function that calls <literal>inherits</literal> to make a new subclass.  The comments
reference <literal>goog.inherits</literal> from Google&#8217;s Closure Library, which contains similar
utility functions to allow more class-style inheritance.</simpara>
<simpara>The end result here is that whenever you make a custom controller, internally
in Backbone, you&#8217;re making <emphasis role="strong">another</emphasis> subclass. The inheritance chain for
<literal>TasksRouter</literal> would then look like:</simpara>
<figure><title>Router class inheritance</title>

<simpara>Phew! Hopefully this adventure into Backbone and JavaScript internals has
taught you that although it&#8217;s more code, it&#8217;s hopefully going to save time down
the road for those maintaining your code.</simpara>

<section id="_composite_views">
<title>Composite views</title>
<simpara>The <literal>SwappingRouter</literal> above calls <literal>leave()</literal> on the view it currently holds.
This function is not part of Backbone itself, and is part of our extension
library to help make views more modular and maintainable. This section goes
over the Composite View pattern, the <literal>CompositeView</literal> class itself, and some
concerns to keep in mind while creating your views.</simpara>
<section id="_refactoring_from_a_large_view">
<title>Refactoring from a large view</title>
<simpara>One of the first refactorings you find yourself doing in a non-trivial Backbone
app is splitting up large views into composable parts. Let&#8217;s take another look
at the <literal>TaskDetail</literal> source code from the beginning of this section:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TaskDetail = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: JST['tasks/tasks_detail'],
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'task',

  events: {
    "click .comments .form-inputs button": "createComment"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "render");

    this.model.bind("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.bind("change", this.render);
    this.model.comments.bind("add", this.render);
  },

  render: function() {
    $(this.el).html(this.template({task: this.model}));
  },

  createComment: function() {
    var comment = new Comment({ text: this.$('.new-comment-input').val() });
    this.$('.new-comment-input').val('');
    this.model.comments.create(comment);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The view class references a template, which renders out the HTML for this page:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;section class="task-details"&gt;
  &lt;input type="checkbox"&lt;%= task.isComplete() ? ' checked="checked"' : '' %&gt; /&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= task.escape("title") %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class="comments"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;% task.comments.each(function(comment) { %&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;&lt;%= comment.user.escape('name') %&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= comment.escape('text') %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;% } %&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;div class="form-inputs"&gt;
    &lt;label for="new-comment-input"&gt;Add comment&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;textarea id="new-comment-input" cols="30" rows="10"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
    &lt;button&gt;Add Comment&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>There are clearly several concerns going on here: rendering the task, rendering
the comments that folks have left, and rendering the form to create new
comments. Let&#8217;s separate those concerns. A first approach might be to just
break up the template files:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/show.jst --&gt;
&lt;section class="task-details"&gt;
  &lt;%= JST['tasks/details']({ task: task }) %&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class="comments"&gt;
  &lt;%= JST['comments/list']({ task: task }) %&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/details.jst --&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"&lt;%= task.isComplete() ? ' checked="checked"' : '' %&gt; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= task.escape("title") %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/list.jst --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;% task.comments.each(function(comment) { %&gt;
    &lt;%= JST['comments/item']({ comment: comment }) %&gt;
  &lt;% } %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;%= JST['comments/new']() %&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/item.jst --&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;%= comment.user.escape('name') %&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= comment.escape('text') %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/new.jst --&gt;
&lt;div class="form-inputs"&gt;
  &lt;label for="new-comment-input"&gt;Add comment&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;textarea id="new-comment-input" cols="30" rows="10"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Add Comment&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>But this is really only half the story. The <literal>TaskDetail</literal> view class still
handles multiple concerns: displaying the task, and creating comments. Let&#8217;s
split that view class up, using the <literal>CompositeView</literal> base class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">CompositeView = function(options) {
  this.children = [];
  Backbone.View.apply(this, [options]);
};

_.extend(CompositeView.prototype, Backbone.View.prototype, {
  leave: function() {
    this.unbind();
    this.remove();
    this._leaveChildren();
    this._removeFromParent();
  },

  removeChild: function(view) {
    var index = this.children.indexOf(view);
    this.children.splice(index, 1);
  },

  renderChild: function(view) {
    view.render();
    this.children.push(view);
    view.parent = this;
  },

  appendChild: function(view) {
    this.renderChild(view);
    $(this.el).append(view.el);
  },

  renderChildInto: function(view, container) {
    this.renderChild(view);
    $(container).html('').append(view.el);
  },

  _leaveChildren: function() {
    var clonedChildren = this.children.slice(0);
    _.each(clonedChildren, function(view) {
      if (view.leave) {
        view.leave();
      }
    });
  },

  _removeFromParent: function() {
    if (this.parent) {
      this.parent.removeChild(this);
    }
  }
});

CompositeView.extend = Backbone.View.extend;</programlisting>
<simpara>Similar to the <literal>SwappingRouter</literal>, the <literal>CompositeView</literal> base class solves common
housekeeping problems by establishing a convention. See the
<link linkend="swapping-internals">Swapping Router and Backbone internals</link> section for an
in-depth analysis of how this subclassing pattern works.</simpara>
<simpara>Now our <literal>CompositeView</literal> maintains an array of its immediate children as
<literal>this.children</literal>.  With this reference in place, a parent view&#8217;s <literal>leave()</literal> method
can invoke <literal>leave()</literal> on its children, ensuring that an entire tree of composed
views is cleaned up properly.</simpara>
<simpara>For child views that can dismiss themselves, such as dialog boxes, children
maintain a back-reference at <literal>this.parent</literal>. This is used to reach up and call
<literal>this.parent.removeChild(this)</literal> for these self-dismissing views.</simpara>
<simpara>Making use of <literal>CompositeView</literal>, we split up the <literal>TaskDetail</literal> view class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var TaskDetail = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: 'section',
  id: 'task',

  initialize: function() {
    _.bindAll(this, "renderDetails");
    this.model.bind("change", this.renderDetails);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.renderLayout();
    this.renderDetail();
    this.renderCommentsList();
  },

  renderLayout: function() {
    $(this.el).html(JST['tasks/show']());
  },

  renderDetails: function() {
    var detailsMarkup = JST['tasks/details']({ task: this.model });
    this.$('.task-details').html(detailsMarkup);
  },

  renderCommentsList: function() {
    var commentsList = new CommentsList({ model: this.model });
    var commentsContainer = this.$('comments');
    this.renderChildInto(commentsList, commentsContainer);
  }
});</programlisting>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var CommentsList = CompositeView.extend({
  tagName: 'ul',

  initialize: function() {
    this.model.comments.bind("add", this.renderComments);
  },

  render: function() {
    this.renderLayout();
    this.renderComments();
    this.renderCommentForm();
  },

  renderLayout: function() {
    $(this.el).html(JST['comments/list']());
  },

  renderComments: function() {
    var commentsContainer = this.$('comments-list');
    commentsContainer.html('');

    this.model.comments.each(function(comment) {
      var commentMarkup = JST['comments/item']({ comment: comment });
      commentsContainer.append(commentMarkup);
    });
  },

  renderCommentForm: function() {
    var commentForm = new CommentForm({ model: this.model });
    var commentFormContainer = this.$('.new-comment-form');
    this.renderChildInto(commentForm, commentFormContainer);
  }
});</programlisting>
<programlisting language="js" linenumbering="unnumbered">var CommentForm = CompositeView.extend({
  events: {
    "click button": "createComment"
  },

  initialize: function() {
    this.model = this.options.model;
  },

  render: function() {
    $(this.el).html(JST['comments/new']);
  },

  createComment: function() {
    var comment = new Comment({ text: $('.new-comment-input').val() });
    this.$('.new-comment-input').val('');
    this.model.comments.create(comment);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Along with this, remove the <literal>&lt;%= JST(&#8230;) %&gt;</literal> template nestings, allowing the
view classes to assemble the templates instead. In this case, each template
contains placeholder elements that are used to wrap child views:</simpara>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/show.jst --&gt;
&lt;section class="task-details"&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section class="comments"&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- tasks/details.jst --&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"&lt;%= task.isComplete() ? ' checked="checked"' : '' %&gt; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= task.escape("title") %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/list.jst --&gt;
&lt;ul class="comments-list"&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;section class="new-comment-form"&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/item.jst --&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;%= comment.user.escape('name') %&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= comment.escape('text') %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</programlisting>
<programlisting language="html" linenumbering="unnumbered">&lt;!-- comments/new.jst --&gt;
&lt;label for="new-comment-input"&gt;Add comment&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;textarea class="new-comment-input" cols="30" rows="10"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;button&gt;Add Comment&lt;/button&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>There are several advantages to this approach:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Each view class has a smaller and more cohesive set of responsibilities.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The comments view code, extracted and decoupled from the task view code, can
  now be reused on other domain objects with comments.
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
The task view performs better, since adding new comments or updating the task
  details will only re-render the pertinent section, instead of re-rendering the
  entire task + comments composite.
</simpara>

<section id="_model_associations">
<title>Model associations</title>
<simpara>Backbone.js doesn&#8217;t prescribe a way to define associations between models, so
we need to get creative and use the power of JavaScript to set up associations
in a way that it&#8217;s usage is natural.</simpara>
<section id="_belongs_to_associations">
<title>Belongs to associations</title>
<simpara>Setting up a <literal>belongs_to</literal> association in Backbone is a two step process. Let&#8217;s
discuss setting up the association that may occur between a task and a user.
The end result of the approach is a <literal>Task</literal> instance having a property called
<literal>user</literal> where we store the associated <literal>User</literal> object.</simpara>
<simpara>To set this up, let&#8217;s start by telling Rails to augment the task&#8217;s JSON
representation to also send over the associated user attributes:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class Task &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user

  def as_json(options = {})
    super(include: { user: { only: [:name, :email] } })
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>This means that when Backbone calls <literal>fetch()</literal> for a <literal>Task</literal> model, it will
include the name and email of the associated user nested within the task JSON
representation. Something like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">{
  "title": "Buy more Cheeseburgers",
  "due_date": "2011-03-04",
  "user": {
    "name": "Robert McGraffalon",
    "email": "bobby@themcgraffalons.com"
  }
}</programlisting>
<simpara>Now that we receive user data with the task&#8217;s JSON representation, let&#8217;s tell
our Backbone User model to store the User object. We do that on the task&#8217;s
initializer. Here&#8217;s a first cut at that:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    this.user = new User(this.get('user'));
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>A couple of improvements to the above: You&#8217;ll soon realize that you will might
be setting the user outside of the initialize as well. Also, the initializer
should check whether there user data in the first place. To address the first
concern, let&#8217;s create a setter for the object. Backbone provides a handy
function called <literal>has</literal> that returns whether the provided option is set for the
object:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    if (this.has('user')) {
      this.user = setUser(new User(this.get('user')));
    }
  },

  setUser: function(user) {
    this.user = user;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>The final setup allows for a nice clean interface to a task&#8217;s user, by
accessing the task property fo the user instance.</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var task = Task.fetch(1);
console.log(task.get('title') + ' is being worked on by ' + task.user.get('name'));</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_has_many_associations">
<title>Has many associations</title>
<simpara>You can take a similar approach to set up a <literal>has_many</literal> association on the
client side models. This time, however, the object&#8217;s property will be a
Backbone collection.</simpara>
<simpara>Following the example, say we need access to a user&#8217;s tasks. Let&#8217;s set up the
JSON representation on the Rails side first:</simpara>
<programlisting language="ruby" linenumbering="unnumbered">class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :tasks

  def as_json(options = {})
    super(include: { tasks: { only: [:body, :due_date] } })
  end
end</programlisting>
<simpara>Now, on the Backbone <literal>User</literal> model&#8217;s initializer, let&#8217;s call the <literal>setTasks</literal>
function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    var tasks = new Tasks.reset(this.get('tasks'));
    this.setTasks(tasks);
  },

  setTasks: function(tasks) {
    this.tasks = tasks;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Note that we are setting the relation to an instance of the <literal>Tasks</literal> collection.</simpara>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_scopes_and_filters">
<title>Scopes and filters</title>
<simpara>To filter a <literal>Backbone.Collection</literal>, like with Rails named scopes, define
functions on your collections that filter by your criteria and return new
instances of the collection class. A first implementation might look like this:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  complete: function() {
    var filteredTasks = this.select(function(task) {
      return task.get('completed_at') !== null;
    });
    return new Tasks(filteredTasks);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Ideally, the filter functions will reuse logic already defined in your model
class:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  isComplete: function() {
    return this.get('completed_at') !== null;
  }
});

var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  complete: function() {
    var filteredTasks = this.select(function(task) {
      return task.isComplete();
    });
    return new Tasks(filteredTasks);
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Going further, you can separate the two concerns here, and extract a <literal>filtered</literal>
function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Task = Backbone.Model.extend({
  isComplete: function() {
    return this.get('completed_at') !== null;
  }
});

var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  complete: function() {
    return this.filtered(function(task) {
      return task.isComplete();
    });
  },

  filtered: function(criteriaFunction) {
    return new Tasks(this.select(criteriaFunction));
  }
});</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_sorting">
<title>Sorting</title>
<simpara>The simplest way to sort a <literal>Backbone.Collection</literal> is to define a <literal>comparator</literal>
function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  comparator: function(task) {
    return task.dueDate;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>If you&#8217;d like to provide more than one sort order on your collection, you can
use an approach similar to the <literal>filtered</literal> function above, and return a new
<literal>Backbone.Collection</literal> whose <literal>comparator</literal> is overridden.  Call <literal>sort</literal> to update
the ordering on the new collection:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  comparator: function(task) {
    return task.dueDate;
  },

  byCreatedAt: function() {
    var sortedCollection = new Tasks(this.models);
    sortedCollection.comparator = function(task) {
      return task.createdAt;
    };
    sortedCollection.sort();
    return sortedCollection;
  }
});</programlisting>
<simpara>Similarly, you can extract the resuable concern to another function:</simpara>
<programlisting language="javascript" linenumbering="unnumbered">var Tasks = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Task,
  url: '/tasks',

  comparator: function(task) {
    return task.dueDate;
  },

  byCreatedAt: function() {
    return this.sortedBy(function(task) {
      return task.createdAt;
    });
  },

  byCompletedAt: function() {
    return this.sortedBy(function(task) {
      return task.completedAt;
    });
  },

  sortedBy: function(comparator) {
    var sortedCollection = new Tasks(this.models);
    sortedCollection.comparator = comparator;
    sortedCollection.sort();
    return sortedCollection;
  }
});</programlisting>
