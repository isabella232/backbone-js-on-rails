=== Automatically using the Rails authentication token

When using Backbone.js in a Rails app, you will run into a conflct with the Rails built in Cross Site Scripting (XSS) protection.

When Rails XSS is enabled, each POST or PUT request to Rails should include a special token which is verified to ensure that the reqtest originated from a user which is actually using the Rails app. In recent versions of Rails, Backbone.js Ajax requests are no exception.

To get around this, you have two options. Disable Rails XSS projection (not recommended), or make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS.

To make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS you can include a monkeypatch to Backbone.js on your pages which patches Backbone.js to include the Rails XSS token in any requests it makes.

The following is one such script.

[js]
source~~~~
include::backbonerailsauthtokenadapter.js[]
source~~~~

The above patch depends on jQuery, and should be included in your after jQuery and Backbone.js are loaded. Using Jammit, you'd list it below the backbone.js file.
