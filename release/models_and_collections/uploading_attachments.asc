=== Uploading attachments (Chapter unstarted)

Notes:

If you upload to a backbone model, you can't do it in a typical async request.
As in, someBackboneModel.save() can't just send a file to the server like other
attributes. We save the attachment in a separate request, and then just swap in
an attachment id on the model. This does mean that you can have "unclaimed"
attachments if somebody bails before saving the parent model, but that's not
really an issue.
