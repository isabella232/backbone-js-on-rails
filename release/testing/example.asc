=== Example: Test-driving a Task application

==== Setup

In this example, we'll be using Cucumber, Capybara, RSpec, and Jasmine to
test-drive a todo list.

The Selenium driver comes configured with Capybara and is the quickest driver to
get running. By default it runs your tests in a remote controlled Firefox
session, so you'll want to install Firefox if you don't have it already.

NOTE: If you'd like to test on a WebKit-based browser, you can set up the
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver[Selenium ChromeDriver] to
run integration tests against Chrome.

The other dependencies you can install by adding them to your Gemfile. The gems
you'll need for testing are jasminerice, jasmine, cucumber-rails, rspec-rails,
and capybara. You'll want to add RSpec, Cucumber, and Jasmine to both the test
and development groups so that you can run generators. With all our testing
dependencies in place, the Gemfile in our sample application looks like this:

[ruby]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/Gemfile[]
source~~~~

If you haven't already, bootstrap your application for Cucumber and Capybara:

[text]
source~~~~
rails generate cucumber:install
source~~~~

Next, bootstrap the application for Jasmine:

[text]
source~~~~
rails generate jasmine:install
source~~~~

You'll want to set up Jasminerice to load all your helpers and specs:

[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/
source~~~~

Finally, you need to mount the Jasminerice engine so that you can run your
Jasmine specs. Add the following routes to config/routes.rb:

[ruby]
source~~~~
if ["development", "test"].include? Rails.env
  mount Jasminerice::Engine => "/jasmine"
end
source~~~~

With this configuration, you can run cucumber scenarios with the cucumber
command and you can run Jasmine tests by running the development server with
`bundle exec rails server` and accessing http://localhost:3000/jasmine in your
browser.

==== Step by step

We'll go outside in: cucumber first, then rspec or jasmine as needed.

TIP: For an in-depth explanation of outside-in test-driven development, see
http://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book[The RSpec Book].

We'd like to be able to add items to a Todo list.  We know this will involve
two parts: a list of existing tasks, and an interface for adding new items to
the list.  We'll start with the list of items, and create fixture data with
https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/v2.1.0/GETTING_STARTED.md[Factory Girl Cucumber steps]:

[text]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/features/users/view_tasks.feature[]
source~~~~

Running this, we see a failure:

[text]
source~~~~
Then I should see "Master backbone" within the tasks list # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:35
  Unable to find css "#tasks table" (Capybara::ElementNotFound)
  (eval):2:in `find'
  ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:29:in `with_scope'
  ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:36:in `/^(.*) within (.*[^:])$/'
  features/view_tasks.feature:13:in `Then I should see "Master backbone" within the tasks list'
source~~~~

A common gotcha when testing Backbone.js Rails apps is seeing false
positives in bootstrapped data. Consider that, if we had just written the step
`Then I should see "Master backbone"` instead of scoping it with `within the
tasks list`, then some test drivers would count the JSON that is used to
bootstrap Backbone collections as visible text on the page, and the test would
pass without us actually rendering the text to the page.

Since this we are doing outside-in development and testing for user interface,
we will need outline the UI first.  To do this, first we'll need a page to host
our code.  Let's create and route a Rails `TasksController`. We'll bootstrap the
Backbone app on `tasks#index`.

[ruby]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/config/routes.rb[]
source~~~~

NOTE: You can also see the route for the
http://rubygems.org/gems/jasminerice[jasminerice gem], which makes the Rails
3.1 asset pipeline (and all of our app assets) available to the Jasmine specs.

[ruby]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb[]
source~~~~

To render our tasks, we'll want a TasksIndex Backbone view class.  But before we
write this class, we'll motivate it with a Jasmine isolation spec:

[javascript]
source~~~~
describe("ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex", function() {
  it("renders a task table", function() {
    var view = new ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex();
    view.render();

    expect(view.$el).toBe("#tasks");
    expect(view.$el).toContain("table");
  });
});
source~~~~

We use the https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery[jasmine-jquery] library
(provided by jasminerice) to provide DOM matchers for Jasmine like
`toContain()`.

To run the Jasmine spec, run the Rails server and visit http://localhost:3000/jasmine

To make this test pass, we'll add a small template and make the `TasksIndex`
view render it:

[ruby]
source~~~~
ExampleApp.Views.TasksIndex = Backbone.View.extend({
  tagName: 'div',
  id: 'tasks',

  initialize: function() {
  },

  render: function () {
    this.$el.html(JST['tasks/index']({}));
    return this;
  }
});
source~~~~

The `app/assets/templates/tasks/index.jst.ejs` template:

[html]
source~~~~
<table></table>
source~~~~

Now our Jasmine specs pass:

image::testing/jasmine-passing.png[title="Passing Jasmine spec"]

Since the Jasmine specs pass, we'll pop back up a level and run the Cucumber
story.  Running it again, the failure is slightly different.  The `"#tasks
table"` element is present on the page, but doesn't contain the content we want.

[text]

    | Master backbone                      |
  And I am on the home page                                   # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
  Then I should see "Master backbone" within the tasks list   # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:35
    expected there to be content "Master backbone" in "Title Completed" (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
    ./features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:107:in `/^(?:|I )should see "([^"]*)"$/'
    features/view_tasks.feature:13:in `Then I should see "Master backbone" within the tasks list'
source~~~~

Drop back down to Jasmine and write a spec motivating the TasksIndex view to
accept a collection and render it.  We'll rewrite our existing spec, since we
are changing the TasksIndex interface to require that a collection be passed in:

[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/spec/javascripts/views/tasks_index_spec.js[]
source~~~~

This spec fails:

[text]
source~~~~
1 spec, 1 failure in 0.008sFinished at Thu Sep 22 2011 18:10:26 GMT-0400 (EDT)

TypeError: undefined is not a function
    at [object Object].<anonymous> (http://localhost:3000/assets/views/tasks_index_spec.js?body=1:4:27)
source~~~~

It's failing because we haven't defined `ExampleApp.Collections.Tasks` yet.  We
need to define a Task model and Tasks collection.  We'll define the model:

[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/app/assets/javascripts/models/task.js[]
source~~~~

write a test to motivate the collection:

[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/spec/javascripts/collections/tasks_spec.js[]
source~~~~

and pass the test by implementing the collection:

[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/app/assets/javascripts/collections/tasks.js[]
source~~~~

Running the Jasmine specs again, we're making progress.  The TasksIndex view is
accepting a collection of tasks, and now we have to render it:

[text]
source~~~~
Expected '<div id="tasks"><table> <tbody><tr> <th>Title</th> <th>Completed</th> </tr> </tbody><div></div><div></div></table> </div>' to have text 'Wake up'.
source~~~~

The simplest thing we can do to get the spec passing is to pass the `tasks`
collection into the template, and iterate over it there:

[javascript]
source~~~~
// app/assets/javascripts/views/tasks_index.js:
include::../../example_app/app/assets/javascripts/views/tasks_index.js[]
source~~~~

[text]
source~~~~
// app/assets/javascripts/templates/tasks/index.jst.ejs:
include::../../example_app/app/assets/templates/tasks/index.jst.ejs[]
source~~~~

Now, Jasmine passes, but the Cucumber story is still failing. 
[text]
source~~~~
Then I should see "Master backbone" within the tasks list # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:35
Unable to find css "#tasks table" (Capybara::ElementNotFound)
source~~~~

This is because the Jasmine spec is an isolation spec, and verifies that the
TasksIndex view works in isolation.  There is additional code we need to write
to hook up the data in the Rails test database to the Backbone view.  Adding
this code to bootstrap the Backbone application should wrap up our exercise and
get the tests passing.

We'll motivate writing a top-level Backbone application object with a spec.
Note the use of a `sinon.spy` for verifying the router instantiation:

spec/javascripts/example_app_spec.js
[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/spec/javascripts/example_app_spec.js[]
source~~~~

Get it to green:

[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/app/assets/javascripts/example_app.js[]
source~~~~

Then we bootstrap the app from the Rails view:

[html]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/app/views/tasks/index.html.erb[]
source~~~~

And the integration test passes!
