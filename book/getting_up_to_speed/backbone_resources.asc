=== Backbone.online resources

This book is not an introduction, and assumes you have some knowledge of
Javascript and of Backbone.js.  Luckily, there is solid documentation available
to get you up to speed on Backbone.

The online documentation for Backbone is very readable:

The GitHub wiki for Backbone links to a large number of tutorials and examples:
