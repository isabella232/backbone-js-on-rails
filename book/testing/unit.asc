* Isolation: Jasmine
* [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) goodies!  Get these.
  * Spy/stub/mock, even your HTTP, with [sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/)
  * If you're looking for factory_girl.js, it's called [Rosie](https://github.com/bkeepers/rosie)
  * [guard-jasmine](https://github.com/netzpirat/guard-jasmine) autotest your Jasmine with headless webkit ([phantomjs](http://www.phantomjs.org/))
  * Write in CoffeeScript and use the 3.1 asset pipeline with [jasminerice](https://github.com/bradphelan/jasminerice)
  * Get started with James Newbery's excellent blog posts on [testing Backbone with Jasmine](http://tinnedfruit.com/2011/03/03/testing-backbone-apps-with-jasmine-sinon.html)
  * Check out his [examples on GitHub](https://github.com/froots/backbone-jasmine-examples)
