=== The Example Application

Rails 3.1.0.rc5 

Ruby 1.9.2

Backbone.js and Underscore.js are the non-minified versions. This is for
informational purposes, but also because the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline will
compress and minify them.

While Rails 3.1 defaults to Coffee script, we have decided to make all example
code normal Javascript as we believe that will be the most understanding to
the current readers.
