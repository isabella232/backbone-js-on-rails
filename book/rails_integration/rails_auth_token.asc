=== Automatically using the Rails authentication token

When using Backbone.js in a Rails app, you will run into a conflict with the
Rails built in Cross Site Scripting (XSS) protection.

When Rails XSS is enabled, each POST or PUT request to Rails should include a
special token which is verified to ensure that the request originated from a
user which is actually using the Rails app. In recent versions of Rails,
Backbone.js Ajax requests are no exception.

To get around this, you have two options. Disable Rails XSS protection (not
recommended), or make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS.

To make Backbone.js play nicely with Rails XSS you can monkeypatch Backbone.js
to include the Rails XSS token in any requests it makes.

The following is one such script:

[javascript]
source~~~~
include::../../example_app/lib/assets/javascripts/backbone.authtokenadapter.js[]
source~~~~

The above patch depends on jQuery, and should be included in your after jQuery
and Backbone.js are loaded. Using Jammit, you'd list it below the backbone.js
file.

In Rails 3.1, you'll place this file in lib/assets/javascripts. In the example
app, you can find this this in
example_app/lib/assets/javascripts/backbone.authtokenadapter.js.
