=== Namespacing your application

You will want to create an object in Javascript for your Backbone.js
application to reside. This variable will serve as a namespace for your
Backbone.js application. Namespacing all of the Javascript is desirable to
avoid potential collisions in naming. For example, it's possible that a
Javascript library you want to use might also create a Task variable. If you
didn't namespace your Task model then this would conflict.

This variable includes a place to hold Models, Collections, Views, and Routes,
and an init method which will be called to initialize the application. It's
very common to create a new Router in the init function, and
Backbone.history.start() must be called in order to route the initial URL.
This app variable will look like the following.

[javascript]
source~~~~
var ExampleApp = {
  Models: {},
  Collections: {},
  Views: {},
  Routers: {},
  init: function() {
    new ExampleApp.Routers.Tasks();
    Backbone.history.start();
  }
};
source~~~~

You can find this file in the example app in
+app/assets/javascripts/example_app.js+.
