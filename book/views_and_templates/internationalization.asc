=== Internationalization (stub)

When you move your application's view logic onto the client, such as with
Backbone, you quickly find that the library support for views is not as
comprehensive as what you have on the server. The
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html[Rails internationalization (i18n) API],
provided via the https://rubygems.org/gems/i18n[i18n gem], is not automatically
available to client-side view rendering.  We'd like to take advantage of that
framework, as well as any localization work you've done if you are adding
Backbone into an existing app.

TODO: Discuss our progress with copycopter_client javascript integration.  For
most i18n cases, this plugin will suffice: https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js
For copycopter, however, we'd like new translations to show up while the app is
running.  Likely we will provide Rack middleware that products the translations
as jsonp.  Waiting until we make more progress for copycopter
