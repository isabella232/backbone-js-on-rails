=== Composite views (in progress)

TODO: Refactor the TaskIndex view class in
tasks_index_and_detail_view_classes.js to be composite.  Discuss other common
places you'll find composite views.  Then, motivate the CompositeView
superclass by referencing the cleanup issue from before, and noting that even
if parent view classes unbind, child view classes may not.
